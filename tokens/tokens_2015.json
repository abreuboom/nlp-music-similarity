I want the time of my life (Mr. Worldwide)\nOh baby\nOoh... give me the time of my life (Ne-Yo: let's get it)\nLet's get it now\n\nPitbull\nThis is the last $20 I got\nBut I'm a have a good time ballin' or out\nTell the bartender line up some shots\n'Cause I'm a get loose tonight\nShe's on fire: she's so hot\nI'm no liar: she burned the spot\nLook like Mariah: I took another shot\nTold her drop: drop: drop: drop it like it's hot\nDirty talk: dirty dance\nShe a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man\nShe on the rebound: broke up with her ex\nAnd I'm like Rodman: ready on deck\nI told her I wanna ride out: and she said yes\nWe didn't go to church: but I got blessed\n\nNe-Yo\nI knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago\nI worked my ass off: but I still can't pay it though\nBut I got just enough to get up in this club\nHave me a good time: before my time is up\nHey: let's get it now\n\nOoh... I want the time of my life: yeah\nOh baby\nOoh... give me the time of my life: hey hey hey\nLet's get it now\n\nPitbull\nTonight I'm a lose my mind\nBetter get yours 'cause I'm gonna get mine\nParty every night like my last\nMommy know the drill: shake that ass\nGo ahead baby let me see what you got\nYou know you got the biggest booty in this spot\nAnd I just wanna see that thing drop\nFrom the back to the front to the top\nYou know me I'm off in the cut\nAlways like a squirrel: looking for a nut\nThis isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck\nI'm not talking 'bout love: I'm talking 'bout lust\nNow let's get loose: have some fun\nForget about bills and the first of the month\nIt's my night: your night: our night: let's turn it up\n\nNe-Yo\nI knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago\nI worked my ass off: but I still can't pay it though\nBut I got just enough to get up in this club\nHave me a good time: before my time is up\nHey: let's get it now\n\nOoh... I want the time of my life\nOh baby\nOoh... give me the time of my life: hey hey hey\nLet's get it now\n\nEverybody going through something\n(Everybody going through something)\nI said: everybody going through something\n(Everybody going through something)\nSo you might as well you roll it up\nPour it up: drink it up: throw it up tonight\nI said: everybody going through something\n(Everybody going through something)\nSaid: everybody going through something\n(Everybody going through something)\nSo you might as well you roll it up\nPour it up: drink it up: throw it up tonight\n\nThis for anybody going through tough times\nBelieve me: been there: done that\nBut everyday above ground is a great day: remember that\n\nNe-Yo\nI knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago\nI worked my ass off: but I still can't pay it though\nBut I got just enough to get up in this club\nHave me a good time: before my time is up\nHey: let's get it now\n\nOoh...

City\nRight about now\nIf a judge for life me: would you stay by my side?\nOr is ya gonna say goodbye?\nCan you tell me right now?\nIf I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life\nShawty: would it be alright?\nCome and show me that you're down\n\nNow tell me would you really ride for me?\nBaby tell me would you die for me?\nWould you spend your whole life with me?\nWould you be there to always hold me down?\n\nTell me would you really cry for me?\nBaby don't lie to me\nIf I didn't have anything\nI wanna know would you stick around?\n\nAdam Levine\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\n\nR. City\nLet's get it diddly-down-down-down\nAll I want is somebody real who don't need much\nA gal I know that I can trust\nTo be here when money low\nIf I did not have nothing else to give but love\nWould that even be enough?\nGal meh need fi know\n\nNow tell me would you really ride for me?\nBaby tell me would you die for me?\nWould you spend your whole life with me?\nWould you be there to always hold me down?\n\nTell me would you really cry for me?\nBaby don't lie to me\nIf I didn't have anything\nI wanna know would you stick around?\n\nAdam Levine\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\n\nR. City\nTell me: tell me: would you want me? (Want me!)\nTell me: tell me: would you call me? (Call me!)\nIf you knew I wasn't ballin'\n'Cause I need a gal who's always by my side\n\nTell me: tell me: do you need me? (Need me)\nTell me: tell me: do you love me: yeah?\nOr is ya just tryna play me?\n'Cause I need a girl to hold me down for life\n\nAdam Levine\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\n\nIf I got locked away\nAnd we lost it all today\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\nIf I showed you my flaws\nIf I couldn't be strong\nTell me honestly: would you still love me the same?\n\nWould you still love me the same?",

Are you here right now: huh?\nWe should all disappear right now\nLook: you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car\nAnd you're comin' to the house: are we clear right now: huh?\nYou see the fleet of all the new things\nCop cars with the loose change\nAll white like I move things\nNiggas see me rollin' and they mood change\nLike a motherfucker\nNew flow: I got a dozen of 'em\nI don't trust you: you are undercover\nI could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other\nTalkin' filets with the truffle butter\nFresh sheets and towels: man she gotta love it\nYeah: they all get what they desire from it\nWhat: tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it\n\nNicki Minaj\nYo: thinkin' out loud\nI must have about a milli on me right now\nAnd I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record\nI'm still the highest sellin' female rapper: for the record\nMan: this a 65 million single sold\nI ain't gotta compete with a single soul\nI'm good with the ballpoint game: finger roll\nAsk me how to do it: I don't tell a single soul\nPretty women: wassup? Is you here right now?\nYou a stand-up or is you in your chair: right now?\nUh: do ya hear me?\nI can't let a wet nigga: get near me\nI might kiss the baddest bitch: if you dare me\nI ain't never need a man: to take care of me\nYo: I'm in that big boy: bitches can't rent this\nI floss everyday: but I ain't a dentist\nYour whole style and approach: I invented\nAnd I ain't takin' that back: 'cause I meant it\n\nLil Wayne\nUh: thinkin' out loud\nI could be broke and keep a million dollar smile\nLOL to the bank checkin' my account\nBank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account\nPretty ladies: are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy\nCuddle buddies on the low\nYou ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning\n'Cause she gonna say: \"I know\"\nCan I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet\nI'll put my leg on the tub\nGirl: this my new dance move: I just don't know what to call it\nBut bitch you dancing with the stars\nI ain't nothin' like your last dude: what's his name? Not important\nI bought some cocaine: you can snort it\nShe became a vacuum: put it on my dick like carpet\nSuck the white off like chocolate\nI'm so heartless: thoughtless: lawless and flawless\nSmallest regardless: largest in charge and born in New Orleans\nGet killed for Jordans\nSkateboard: I'm gnarly; Drake: Tunechi and Barbie\nYou know",

(I promise that... let you go...)\nBaby: I don't care if you got her in your heart; \nAll I really care is you wake up in my arms... (Wake up in my arms...)\nOne last time: I need to be the one who takes you home...\n\nOne last time: I need to be the one who takes you home...",

I was confused about\nShe should figure it out: while I'm sat here singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe\n\n*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door\nI don't even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder: but I already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didn't need to take him to bed: that's all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex: of course\nIt's not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun: and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realized what you wanted\nIt's a bit too much: too late if I'm honest\nAll this time: God knows I'm singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe",

        "Lyrics": "(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)\n\nI'm sorry if I seem uninterested\nOh I'm not listenin': oh I'm indifferent\nTruly I ain't got no business here\nBut since my friends are here: I just came to kick it\nBut really I would rather be at home all by myself\nNot in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being\nI don't dance: don't ask: I don't need a boyfriend\nSo you can go back: please enjoy your party: I'll be here\n\nSomewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana\nWith this boy who's hollerin' I can hardly hear\nOver this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you\nSo tell my friends that I'll be over here\n\nOh oh oh here: oh oh oh here\nOh oh oh I ask myself: what am I doin' here?\nOh oh oh here: oh oh oh here\nAnd I can't wait till we can break up out of here\n\nExcuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this\nAn antisocial pessimist but usually I don't mess with this\nAnd I know you mean only the best\nAnd your intentions aren't to bother me: but honestly I'd rather be\nSomewhere with my people: we can kick it and just listen to\nSome music with the message: (like we usually do)\nAnd we'll discuss our big dreams: how we plan to take over the planet\nSo pardon my manners: I hope you'll understand that I'll be here\n\nNot there in the kitchen\nWith the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends\nOh tell them I'll be here\nRight next to the boy who's throwin' up\n'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more\nOh God: why am I here?\n\nOh oh oh here: oh oh oh here\nOh oh oh I ask myself: what am I doin' here?\nOh oh oh here: oh oh oh here\nAnd I can't wait till we can break up out of here\n\nHours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator\nSome girl talkin' 'bout a hater: she ain't got none\nHow did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this\nSo holla at me: I'll be in the car when you're done\nI'm stand-offish: don't want what you're offerin'\nAnd I'm done talkin': awfully sad it had to be that way\nSo tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready\nAnd I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low\nYo I'll be over here\n\nOh oh oh here: oh oh oh here\nOh oh oh I ask myself: what am I doin' here?\nOh oh oh here: oh oh oh here\nAnd I can't wait till we can break up out of here",
