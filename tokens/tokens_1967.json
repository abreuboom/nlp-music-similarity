        "Lyrics": "It was the third of June: another sleepy: dusty Delta day\nI was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay\nAnd at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat\nAnd Mama hollered out the back door: \"Y'all remember to wipe your feet.\"\nAnd then she said: \"I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge.\nToday Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"\n\nAnd Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas\n\"Well: Billie Joe never had a lick of sense. Pass the biscuits: please.\nThere's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow.\"\nAnd Mama said it was a shame about Billie Joe: anyhow\nSeems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\nAnd brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe\nHe put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show\nAnd wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?\n\"I'll have another piece of apple pie. You know: it don't seem right.\nI saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge.\nAnd now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"\n\nMama said to me: \"Child: what's happened to your appetite?\nI've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite.\nThat nice young preacher: Brother Taylor: dropped by today.\nSaid he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday. Oh: by the way:\nHe said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge.\nAnd she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge.\"\n\nA year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe\nAnd brother married Becky Thompson: they bought a store in Tupelo\nThere was a virus going 'round: Papa caught it and he died last Spring\nAnd now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything\nAnd me: I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",

(He's been lonely too long.)\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\n\nAs I look back:\nI can see me lost and searching.\nNow I find that I can choose: I'm free. Oh: Yeah!\nSo funny I just have to laugh:\nAll my troubles been torn in half.\nI been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)\nLonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\n\nIn the past it's come and gone:\nI feel like I can't go on without love.\n(Lonely): lonely too long\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely)\n\nJust see me now\nMakes it worth the time I've waited.\nShe was all I need to make me see: Oh: Yeah!\nI keep hopin' with all my mind:\nEverything gonna turn out right.\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long).\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\n\nNow look at me\nGliding through this world of beauty\nEverything I do brings ecstasy: Oh: Yeah!\nNo wonder I could die\nI feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high!\nI've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)\nLonely too long. (He's been lonely.)\n\nFound myself somebody. (He's been lonely)\nDon't have to be alone no more. (He's been lonely: He's been lonely.)\nDon't have to alone no more: no more. (He's been lonely: He's been lonely.)",

        "Lyrics": "Hearts go astray: leaving hurt when they go \nI went away: just when you: you needed me so \nFilled with regret: I come back begging you\nWon't you forget: welcome love we once knew \n\nOpen up your eyes: then you'll realize \nHere I stand with my: everlasting love \nNeed you by my side: girl to be my bride \nYou'll never be denied: everlasting love \nFrom the very start: open up your heart \nBe a lasting part of everlasting love \n\n(Need a love to last forever) \n(Need a love to last forever) \n\nWhere life's river flows: no one really knows \nTill someone's there to show the way to lasting love \nLike the sun shines: endlessly it shines \nYou always will be mine: it's eternal love \nWhen other's love-light's gone: ours will still be strong \nWe'll have our very own: everlasting love \n\n(Real love to last forever) \n(Real love to last forever) \n\nOpen up your eyes: then you'll realize \nHere I stand with my: everlasting love \nNeed you by my side: girl to be my bride \nYou'll never be denied: everlasting love \nFrom the very start: open up your heart \nBe a lasting part of everlasting love \nWhen other's love-light's gone: ours will still be strong \nWe'll have our very own: everlasting love",

It feels so groovy to say\n\nI dig The Mamas & The Papas at the trip Sunset Strip in L.A.\nAnd they got a good thing goin' when the words don't get in the way\nAnd when they're really wailing\nMichelle and Cass are sailin'\nHey! They really nail me to the wall\n\nI dig Donovan in a dream-like: tripped out way\nHis crystal images: hey: they tell you 'bout a brighter day\nAnd when The Beatles tell you\nThey've got a word \"love\" to sell you\nThey mean exactly what they say\n\nI dig rock and roll music\nI could really get it on in that scene\nI think I could say somethin' if you know what I mean\nBut if I really say it\nThe radio won't play it\nUnless I lay it between the lines",
