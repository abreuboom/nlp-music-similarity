Whoa\n\nDid I think I've seen shawty get low\nAin't the same when it's up that close\nMake it rain I'm making it snow\nWork the pole I got the bank roll\n\nI'm a say that I prefer them no clothes\nI'm into that: I love women exposed\nShe threw it back at me I gave her mo'\nCash ain't a problem: I know where it goes\n\nShe had them Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)\nBoots with the fur (with the fur)\nThe whole club was looking at her\nShe hit the floor (she hit the floor)\nNext thing you know\nShawty got low: low: low: low: low: low: low: low\n\nThem baggy sweat pants\nAnd the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)\nShe turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)\nShe hit the floor (she hit the floor)\nNext thing you know\nShawty got low: low: low: low: low: low: low: low\n\nHey shawty: what I gotta do to get you home\nMy jeans filled with gwap and they're ready for show\nIt's Cadillacs: Maybach for the sexy grown\nPatr&#xF3;n on the rocks that'll make you moan\n\nOne stack (come on): two stacks (come on): three stacks (come on)\nNow that's three grand\nWhat you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man\nI ain't dealing rubber bands\n\nThat's what I told her\nHer legs on my shoulder\nI knew it was over\nThat Henny and Cola\nGot me like a soldier\nShe ready for rover\nI couldn't control her\nSo lucky on me: I was just like clover\n\nShawty was hot like a toaster\nSorry but I had to fold her\nLike a pornography poster\nShe showed her\n\nApple Bottom jeans (jeans)\nBoots with the fur (with the fur)\nThe whole club was looking at her\nShe hit the floor (she hit the floor)\nNext thing you know\nShawty got low: low: low: low: low: low: low: low\n\nThem baggy sweat pants\nAnd the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)\nShe turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)\nShe hit the floor (she hit the floor)\nNext thing you know\nShawty got low: low: low: low: low: low: low: low\n\nWhoa shawty: yeah she was worth the money\nLil' mama took my cash\nAnd I ain't want it back\nThe way she bent that back\nGot all them paper stacks\nTattoo above her crack\nI had to handle that\n\nI was on it sexy woman\nLet me show it: made me want it\nTwo in the morning: I'm zoned in\nThem ros&#xE9; bottles foaming\n\nShe wouldn't stop: made it drop\nShawty did that pop & lock\nHad to break her off that gwap\nGal was fine: just like my glock\n\nApple Bottom jeans (jeans)\nBoots with the fur (with the fur)\nThe whole club was looking at her\nShe hit the floor (she hit the floor)\nNext thing you know\nShawty got low: low: low: low: low: low: low: low\n\nThem baggy sweat pants\nAnd the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)\nShe turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)\nShe hit the floor (she hit the floor)\nNext thing you know\nShawty got low: low: low: low: low: low: low: low\n\nCome on",

        "Lyrics": "Closed off from love: I didn't need the pain\nOnce or twice was enough and it was all in vain\nTime starts to pass: before you know it you're frozen\nBut something happened for the very first time with you\nMy heart melted to the ground: found something true\nAnd everyone's looking 'round: thinking I'm going crazy\n\nBut I don't care what they say: I'm in love with you\nThey try to pull me away: but they don't know the truth\nMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding: keep: keep bleeding love\nI keep bleeding: I keep: keep bleeding love\nKeep bleeding: keep: keep bleeding love\nYou cut me open\n\nTrying hard not to hear: but they talk so loud\nTheir piercing sounds fill my ears: try to fill me with doubt\nYet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling: ooh yeah\nBut nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace\nAnd in this world of loneliness: I see your face\nYet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy\nMaybe: maybe\n\nBut I don't care what they say: I'm in love with you\nThey try to pull me away: but they don't know the truth\nMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding: keep: keep bleeding love\nI keep bleeding: I keep: keep bleeding love\nKeep bleeding: keep: keep bleeding love\nYou cut me open\n\nAnd it's draining all of me\nThough they find it hard to believe\nI'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see\n\nI don't care what they say: I'm in love with you\nThey try to pull me away: but they don't know the truth\nMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing\nOoh: you cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding love\nOh: you cut me open and I\n\nOh: I keep bleeding love\nI keep \nOoh: you cut me open and I\nKeep bleeding: keep: keep bleeding love: oh",

        "Lyrics": "Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?\nIf I should die before I wake\nIt's cause you took my breath away\nLosing you is like living in a world with no air: oh \n\nChris Brown\nI'm here alone: didn't wanna leave\nMy heart won't move: It's incomplete\nIf there was a way that I could make you understand\n\nBut how do you expect me to live alone with just me?\nCause my world revolves around you: it's so hard for me to breathe\n\nTell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?\nCan't live: can't breathe with no air\nIt's how I feel whenever you ain't there\nThere's no air: no air\n\nGot me out here in the water so deep\nTell me how you gonna breathe without me?\nIf you ain't here I just can't breathe\nThere's no air: no air\n\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\n\nChris Brown\nI walked: I ran: I jumped: I flew\nRight off the ground To float to you\nWith no gravity to hold me down for real\n\nBut somehow I'm still alive inside\nYou took my breath but I survived\nI don't know how but I don't even care\n\nSo how do you expect me to live alone with just me?\nCause my world revolves around you: it's so hard for me to breathe\n\nTell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?\nCan't live: can't breathe with no air\nThat's how I feel whenever you ain't there\nThere's no air: no air\n\nGot me out here in the water: so deep\nTell me how you gonna breathe without me?\nIf you ain't here I just can't breathe\nThere's no air: no air\n\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\n\nNo more\nBaby\nThere's no air: no air\nNo air: oh!\n\nTell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?\nI can't live: I can't breathe with no air\nThat's how I feel whenever you ain't there\nThere's no air: no air\n\nGot me out here in the water: so deep\nTell me how you gonna breathe without me?\nIf you ain't here I just can't breathe\nThere's no air: no air\n\nTell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?\nI can't live: I can't breathe with no air\nThat's how I feel whenever you ain't there\nThere's no air: no air\n\nGot me out here in the water: so deep\nTell me how you gonna breathe without me?\nIf you ain't here I just can't breathe\nThere's no air: no air\n\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\nNo air: air\nNo air",

(Yeah)\n'Cause you asked for it\n'Cause you need one\nYou see: I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)\n'Cause you tell me it's\nMake or breakin' this\nIf you're on your way (Oh: oh)\nI'm not gonna write you to stay\n\nIf your heart is nowhere in it\nI don't want it for a minute (for a minute)\nBabe: I'll walk the seven seas (the seven seas)\nWhen I believe that there's a reason\nTo write you a love song today (write you a love song today)\nToday: yeah",

Long live the king!\"\n\nOne minute I held the key\nNext the walls were closed on me\nAnd I discovered that my castles stand\nUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror: my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nOnce you'd gone there was never\nNever an honest word\nAnd that was when I ruled the world\n\nIt was the wicked and wild wind\nBlew down the doors to let me in\nShattered windows and the sound of drums\nPeople couldn't believe what I'd become\n\nRevolutionaries wait\nFor my head on a silver plate\nJust a puppet on a lonely string\nOh who would ever want to be king?\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror: my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Peter won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror: my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Peter won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world",

No!\nNo disrespect: but this killer from another level: cut the check\n\nAw.\nTell King Mac stop the press\nSay kid: can I get a witness?\n\nAkon:\nGirl I can notice but to\nNotice you\nNoticin' me\nFrom across the room\n\nI can see it that can't stop myself from lookin'\nAnd noticin' you noticin' me\nWatch out I've seen her type before\nThat girl is so dangerous\n\nThat girl is so dangerous\nThat girl is a bad girl\nI've seen her type before she's so dangerous\nThat girl is so dangerous\nThat girl is a bad girl: yeah\n\nI see you got that fire by the way that your walkin'\nFrom left to right I watched her go down\nGirl I just want it right now don't wanna do no talkin'\nShawty's so right I need to slow down\n\nKardinal Offishall:\nFigure 8\nGood body shape\nWhen she on the dance floor: tell 'em I rip\nWhen she do her thing man: can't watch shit\nThat beat soak up everything our grib\n\nBad heels like Jessica P\nI'm tryin' to give homegirl sex and the cit-tit-tit-tity\nItty bitty waistline moves with the baseline\nOne look: I'll punch: I'm fine!\n\nAkon:\nGirl I can notice but to\nNotice you\nNoticin' me\nFrom across the room\n\nI can see it that can't stop myself from lookin'\nAnd noticin' you noticin' me\nWatch out I've seen her type before\nThat girl is so dangerous\nThat girl is so dangerous\n\nThat girl is a bad girl\nI've seen her type before she's so dangerous\nThat girl is so dangerous\nThat girl is a bad girl: yeah",

Who that say they gonna beat Lil Wayne?\nMy name ain't Bic: but I keep that flame: man\nWho that wanna do that: boy?\nYa knew that true the swallow\nAnd I be the shit: now you got loose bowels\nI don't owe you like two vowels\nBut I would like you to pay me by the hour: ha-ha\nAnd I'd rather be pushin' flowers\nThan to be in the pen sharin' showers\nTony told us this world was ours\nAnd the Bible told every girl was sour\nDon't play in her garden and don't smell her flower\nCall me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower\nBoy: I got so many bitches like Mike Lowry\nEven Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me\nMotherfucka: I say life ain't shit without me\nChrome lips pokin' out the coupe: look like it's poutin'\nI do what I do: and you do what you can do about it\nBitch: I can turn a crack rock into a mountain: dare me\nDon't you compare me: 'cause there ain't nobody near me\nThey don't see but they hear me: they don't feel me but they fear me\nI'm illy\n\nC3: 3P",

Where my money at?\n\nSee I'mma tell you like Wu told me\nCash rules everything around me\nSingin' dollar: dollar bill: yeah (dollar: dollar bill: yeah)\nSingin' dollar: dollar bill: yeah (dollar: dollar bill: yeah)\n\nSee I'mma tell you like Wu told me\nCash rules everything around me\nSingin' dollar: dollar bill: yeah (dollar: dollar bill: yeah)\nSingin' dollar: dollar bill: yeah (dollar: dollar bill: yeah)\n\nSome live for the bill\nSome kill for the bill Yeah: where my money at?\nShe wind for the bill\nGrind for the bil woah: where my money at?\nSome steal for the bill if they got to pay the bill\nYeah...

(No...)\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nBut you won't let me\nYou upset me girl\nAnd then you kiss my lips\nAll of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)\nCan't remember what you did\n\n(Rihanna)\nBut I hate it...\nYou know exactly what to do\nSo that I can't stay mad at you\nFor too long that's wrong\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nBut I hate it...\nYou know exactly how to touch\nSo that I don't want to fuss and fight no more\nSaid I despise that I adore you\n\n(Rihanna)\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)\nI can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy (ooh whoa...)\nBut I just can't let you go\nAnd I hate that I love you so (ooh...)\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nYou completely know the power that you have\nThe only one that makes me laugh\n\n(Rihanna)\nSaid and it's not fair\nHow you take advantage of the fact\nThat I... love you beyond a reason why\nAnd it just ain't right\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nAnd I hate how much I love you girl\nI can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)\nAnd I hate how much I love you girl\nBut I just can't let you go\nBut I hate that I love you so\n\n(Both)\nOne of these days maybe your magic won't affect me\nAnd your kiss won't make me weak...\nBut no one in this world knows me the way you know me\nSo you'll probably always have a spell on me...\n\n(Ne-Yo)\nYeah... ooh...\n\n(Rihanna)\nThat's how much I love you (how much I need you)\nThat's how much I need you (how much I love you)\nThat's how much I love you (oh: need you)\nThat's how much I need you\n\nAnd I hate that I love you so...\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy\nI can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)\nAnd I hate how much I love you boy\nBut I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no...)\nAnd I hate that I love you so\n\n(Both)\nAnd I hate that I love you so... so.",

Did you do something new?\nWell you're name ain't on the guest list: who brung you?\nYou: the more famous person you come through\nAnd the sexy lady next to you: you come too\nAnd then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me\nI'm too uncouth: unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe\nToo much of a newcomer and too uncool\nLike Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well\nThough I need a holiday like lady who sung blue\nGo back what ever you did you undo\nHeavy as Heaven: the devil on my two tons too\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n\nMatthew Santos\nIf you are what they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear: the camera's here\nAnd the microphones and they wanna know\n\nLupe Fiasco\nAnd you better wear your shades\nThe spotlights here can burn holes through the stage\nDown through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid\nAnd out through China nearly misses air liners\nMagnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer\nRicochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze\nNow that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade\nWe want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay\nLike the governor called and he told him to wait\nUn-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage\nThe audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise\nThey want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n\nMatthew Santos\nIf you are that they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear: the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on and they want a show\n\nLupe Fiasco\nSo chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away\n'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days\nMe and security ain't getting along\nAnd when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone\nSo just take me home where the mood is mellow\nAnd the roses are thrown: M&M's are yellow\nAnd the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker\nEverybody gets a nice autographed picture\nOne for you and one for your sister\nWho had to work tonight but is an avid listener\nEvery songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback\nAll the reviewers say you need to go and see that\nAnd everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased\nThen they all take the stage and start performing for me\nLike ha ha ha ha ha...\nHa ha ha ha ha... ha\n\nMatthew Santos\nIf you are what they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear: the camera's here\nAnd the microphones and they wanna know\nIf you are that they say you are - a superstar\nThen have no fear: the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on and they want a show",

I can't breathe . ouh no no I can't breathe ouh no no I can't breathe .oh woo ouh\n\nOoh no no I can't breathe Ooh no no I can't breathe (I can't breathe).",

Yeah: that's my bodyguard\nWear a lot of jewelery Young don't do security\nIt was whiter than a napkin: harder than a dinner plate\nIf you want it come and get it\nYou know I stay super straight\nRan up in my spots and now I'm workin' at the Super 8\nKnow you niggas hungry: come and get a super plate\nY'all sing Happy Birthday: yeah I got that super cake\nHundred karat bracelet: I use it like some super bait\nI put on for my city: on on for my city\nI put on for my city: on on for my city\nPut on (east side)\nPut on (south side)\nPut on (west side)\nPut on (x2)\n\nHalf bag: top back: ain't nothin' but a young thug\nHKs: AKs: I need to join a gun club\nBig wheels: big straps: you know I like it super sized\nPassenger's a redbone: her weave look like some curly fries\nInside's fish sticks: outside tartar sauce\nPocket full of celery: imagine what she tellin' me\nBlowin' on asparagus: the realest shit I ever smoked\nRidin' to that Trap or Die: the realest shit I ever wrote\nThey know I got that broccoli: so I keep that glock on me\nDon't get caught without one: comin' from where I'm from\nCall me Jeezy Hamilton: flyin' down Campbellton\nSo fresh: so clean: on my way to Charlene\n\n(Kanye)\nI put on... (x3)\nI put on for my city: I put on for my\nI put on for my city: I put on for my city\nOn\n\nI feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks\nI feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex\nI feel like this but niggas don't know the stress\nI lost the only girl in the world that know me best\nI got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit\nI got the Jesus on a chain: man that don't mean shit\n'Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace\nYo: I need just at least one of Russell's nieces\nOn... I let my nightmares go\nI put on: everybody that I knew from the go\nI know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke\nThey say damn: Yeezy Yeezy: you don't know us no more\nYou got that big fame homie: and you just changed homie\nYou can ask big homie: man the top sure lonely I ain't lyin'\nSo lonely I ain't lyin'\nLet me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)\nI'm high as a satellite (satellite)\nI see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)\n'Cause every night every night\nI put on\n\nLet me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)\nI'm high as a satellite (satellite)\nI see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)\n'Cause every night every night\nLet me see what we have tonight\nI'm high as a satellite\nI see those flashin' lights",

(why do I keep running)\nAll I ever think about is you (all I ever think about)\nYou've got my hypnotized (hypnotized): so mesmerized (mesmerized)\nAnd I just got to know\n\nDo you ever think (ever think) when you're all alone (all alone)\nAll that we could be: where this thing could go? (go)\nAm I crazy or falling in love? (crazy)\nIs it real or just another crush? (another crush: yeah: yeah)\n\nDo you catch a breath when I look at you?\nAre you holding back: like the way you do?\n'Cause I'm trying: trying to walk away (whoa)\nBut I know this crush ain't goin' away (this crush ain't)\nGoin' away\nGoin' away\nGoin' away",

        "Lyrics": "Hey what's happinin' homie?\nIt's your lil' one plies man\nI ran across the eyes of a lil' baby the other day homie\nLil' mama so bad she had me hypnotized\nI couldn't get my eyes off her\nLet me tell you how it's like to be hypnotized\n\nAkon\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\n\nIt's 2:00 in the mornin'\nI'm yiked up and I'm horny\nAll I need now is some moanin'\nThat pussy got me zoanin'\nHer vibe tell me she want it\nShe gotta fuck how she on me\nI got her tonight 'cause she joanin'\nI know in the panty she foamin'\nI'm locked eyes on that monkey\nI know she wet: 'cause she told me\nThat ass on the she pokin'\nEvery nigga in here scopin'\nI see me up in her pokin'\nShe bent over and I'm strokin'\nHer cheeks spread wide opened\nI'm beatin' it and I'm focused\n\nAkon\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\n\nAkon\nNow do it some more (just like that)\nJust do it some more (yes just like that)\nGirl do it some more (now shake that ass: make a nigga like me spend that cash)\nNow do it some more (just like that)\nJust do it some more (yes just like that)\nGirl do it some more (now shake that ass: make a nigga like me spend that cash)\n\nShe bad as hell and she swoll\nI'm tryin' to play in her hole\nLil' mama a dime: she cold\nI fuck her once and she sold\nI want her naked no clothes\nI'm into private shows\nNo limit anything goes\nI'm a let her ride me her toes\nJust stand in front of me and pose\nYou touch mine: I touch yours\nTo get her sprung is my goal\nFirst time I seen her I froze\nI had to get her she knows\nShe buck'd it then she fold\n'Cause I'm too real and she knows\nShe wanna goon and it show\n\nAkon\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\n\nAkon\nNow do it some more (just like that)\nJust do it some more (yes just like that)\nGirl do it some more (now shake that ass: make a nigga like me spend that cash)\nNow do it some more (just like that)\nJust do it some more (yes just like that)\nGirl do it some more (now shake that ass: make a nigga like me spend that cash)\n\nAkon\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down\nYou got me so hypnotized\nThe way your body rollin' round and round\nThat booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down",

(Welcome to the good life)\nLike I'm new in the hood\nThe only thing I wish: I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life)\nHe probably think he could\nBut: but: I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)\n50 told me: \"Go 'head: switch the style up\nAnd if they hate then let 'em hate\nAnd watch the money pile up: the good life\"\n\nNow I: I go for mine: I got to shine\n(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)\nNow I: I go for mine: I got to shine\n(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky\nI'mma get on this TV momma: I'mma\nI'mma put shit down)\nAy: (Ay): Ay: (Ay)\nAy: (Ay): Ay: (I'm good)\n\nHave you ever popped champagne on a plane\nWhile gettin' some brain?\nWhipped it out: she said: \"I never seen Snakes on a Plane\"\nWhether you broke or rich you gotta get this\nHavin' money's not everything not havin' it is\nI was splurgin' on Tryst: but when I get my card back\nActivated: I'm back to Vegas\n'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'\nBefore I had it: I closed my eyes and imagined the good life\n\nT-Pain:\nBetter than the life I lived\nWhen I thought that I was gonna go crazy\nAnd now my grandmama\nAin't the only girl callin' me: \"Baby\"\nIf you feelin' me now\nThen put yo' hands up in the sky: and let me hear you say\nHey: hey: ooh I'm good",

I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...\n\n\"Marry me: Juliet: you'll never have to be alone\nI love you: and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad: go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story: baby: just say...yes!\"\n\nOh: oh: oh\nOh: oh: oh: oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!",

        "Lyrics": "It was 1989\nMy thoughts were short: my hair was long\nCaught somewhere between a boy and man\nShe was seventeen\nAnd she was far from in between\nIt was summertime in northern Michigan\n\nSplashing through the sandbar\nTalking by the campfire\nIt's the simple things in life like when and where\nWe didn't have no internet\nBut man I never will forget\nThe way the moonlight shined upon her hair\n\nAnd we were trying different things\nAnd we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle\nNot thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\n\nCatching walleye from the dock\nWatching the waves roll off the rocks\nShe'll forever hold a spot inside my soul\nWe'd blister in the sun\nWe couldn't wait for night to come\nTo hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll\n\nWhile we were trying different things\nAnd we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle\n\nNot thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nTurn it up\n\nNow nothing seems as strange\nAs when the leaves begin to change\nOr how we thought those days would never end\nSometimes I hear that song\nAnd I start to sing along\nAnd think: man: I'd love to see that girl again\n\nAnd we were trying different things\nAnd we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle\nNot thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\n\nWe were trying different things\nAnd we were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle\n\nNot thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long",

        "Lyrics": "Punk ass motherfucka!\nBitch ass nigga!\nWhat were you gonna do?\nKill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga?\nTupac: Biggie shut the fuck up!\nFucking dogs: alwayz barking shit...\nDon't shoot me! Don't shoot me!\nFuck you nigga!\n\nLil Wayne\nAnd I'm grindin' until I'm tired\n'Cause they say you ain't grindin' until you die\nSo I'm grinding with my eyes wide\nLooking to find\nA way through the day\nA light for the night\nDear lord: you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)\nLike what the hell am I doing right?\n\nThe Game\nTake me away from the hood: like a state penitentiary\nTake me away from the hood: in a casket or a Bentley\nTake me away...\nLike I overdosed on cocaine\nOr take me away: like a bullet from Kurt Cobain\nSuicide: I'm from a windy city\nLike Do or Die\nFrom a block close to where Biggie was crucified\nThat was Brooklyn's Jesus: shot for no fucking reason.\nAnd you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces. (My life!)\nCause that's Jesus people: and Game he's the equal\nHated on so much: Passion of Christ need a sequel\nYeah: like Roc-a-Fella needed Sigel\nLike I needed my father: but he needed a needle (My life!)\nI need some meditation: so I can lead my people\nThey askin' why?\nWhy did John Lennon leave The Beatles?\nAnd why every hood nigga feed off evil?\nAnswer my question: 'fore this bullet leave this desert eagle\n\nLil Wayne\nAnd I'm grindin' until I'm tired\nAnd you ain't grindin' until you die\nSo I'm grinding with my eyes wide\nLooking to find\nA way through the day\nA light for the night\nDear lord: you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)\nLike what the hell am I doing right?\n\nThe Game\nWe are not the same: I am a Martian.\nSo approach my Phantom doors with caution.\nYou see them 24's spinnin'\nI earned 'em.\nI ain't no preacher: but here's my Erick Sermon\nSo eat this black music: and tell me how it taste now\nAnd fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now\nSometimes I think about my life with my face down\nThen I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile\nDamn I know his mama proud\nAnd since you helped me sell my dream: we can share my mama now\nAnd like MJB: no more drama now\nLivin' the good life: me and Common on common ground\nI spit crack: and niggas could drive it outta town\nGot a Chris Paul mindstate: I'm never out of bounds\nMy life used to be empty: like a glock without a round\nNow my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds\n\nLil Wayne\nAnd I'm grindin' until I'm tired\nAnd you ain't grindin' until you die\nSo I'm grinding with my eyes wide\nLooking to find\nA way through the day\nA light for the night\nDear lord: you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)\nLike what the hell am I doing right?\n\nThe Game\nWalked through the gates of hell: see my Impala parked in front\nWith the high beams on\nMe and the devil sharing chronic blunts\nListening to The Chronic album: playin' backwards\nShootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice\nMy mind fucked up: so I cover it with a Raider hood\nI'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge\nMade my grandmother pray for good\nIt never made her happy: but I bet that new Mercedes could\nAin't no bars: but niggas can't escape the hood\nThey took so many of my niggas: that I should hate the hood\nBut it's real niggas like me that make the hood\nRidin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should\nWith the top back: and my Sox hat\nI'm Paid in Full: the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that\nEven if they brought the nigga Pac back\nI'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back\n\nLil Wayne\nAnd I'm grindin' until I'm tired\nAnd you ain't grindin' until you die\nSo I'm grinding with my eyes wide\nLooking to find\nA way through the day\nA light for the night\nDear: you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)\nLike what the hell am I doing right?\n\nMy Life (my life: my life: my life)\nMy Life (my life: my life: my life)\nMy Life (my life: my life: my life)\nMy Life (my life: my life: my life)",

        "Lyrics": "Oh...\nRemember...\nOh: I remember...\nI wanna know...\n\nWhere were you when I said I loved you?\nAnd where were you when I cried at night?\nWaiting up: couldn't sleep without you.\nThinking of all the times we shared.\n\nI remember when my heart broke.\nI remember when I gave up loving you.\nMy heart couldn't take no more of you.\nI was sad and lonely.\nI remember when I walked out.\nI remember when I screamed I hated you.\nBut somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.\nI'm sad and lonely.\n\nNo one knew all the pain I went through.\nAll the love I saved deep in my heart for you.\nDidn't know where I would go: where I would be.\nBut you made me leave.\nAnd plus my heart: it just: it kept telling me so.\n\nI remember when my heart broke.\nI remember when I gave up loving you.\nMy heart couldn't take no more of you.\nI was sad and lonely.\nI remember when I walked out.\nI remember when I said I hated you.\nBut somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.\nSo sad and lonely.\n\nThere was nowhere else to go: oh.\nNobody else to turn to: no.\nFor the rest of my life\nI promised myself: I will love me first genuinely.\n\nI remember when my heart broke.\nI remember when I gave up loving you.\nMy heart couldn't take no more of you.\nI was sad and lonely.\nI remember when I walked out.\nI remember when I said I hated you.\nBut somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.\nSad and lonely.\n\nI remember when I walked out.\nI remember when I gave up loving you.\nMy heart couldn't take no more of you.\nSo sad and lonely: hey.\nI remember when I stormed out.\nI remember when I gave up loving you.\nI was sad and lonely.",
