(these chains)\nNo one can change your life except for you\nDon't ever let anyone step all over you\nJust open your heart and your mind: mmm\nIs it really fair to feel this way inside? Whoa\n\nSomeday: somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye\nUntil then: baby: are you gonna let them hold you down and make you cry?\nDon't you know? Don't you know things'll change?\nThings'll go your way\nIf you hold on for one more day\nCan you hold on for one more day?\nThings'll go your way\nHold on for one more day\n\nYou could sustain (you could sustain)\nOr are you comfortable with the pain?\nYou've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (no: baby)\nYou got yourself into your own mess (ooh)\nLetting your worries pass you by (letting your worries pass you by)\nBaby: don't you think it's worth your time\nTo change your mind? (no: no)\n\nSomeday: somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye\nUntil then: baby: are you gonna let them hold you down and make you cry?\nDon't you know? Don't you know things'll change?\nThings'll go your way\nIf you hold on for one more day\nCan you hold on for one more day?\nThings'll go your way (oh: things'll go your way)\nHold on for one more day\n\nI know that there is pain: but you\nHold on for one more day: and ya\nBreak free from the chains\nYeah: I know that there is pain\nBut you hold on for one more day\nAnd ya break free: break from the chains\n\nSomeday: somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye (say goodbye)\nUntil then: baby: are you gonna let them hold you down and make you cry?\nDon't you know\nDon't you know (know) things'll change? (know)\nThings'll go your way\nIf you hold on for one more day: yeah\nHold on\n\nDon't you know: things'll change\nThings'll go your way\nIf you hold on for one more day\nCan you hold on?\n\nCan you hold on?\nMmm: can you hold on: baby?\nWon't you tell me now?\nHold on for one more day \n'Cause it's gonna go your way\n\nDon't you know things'll change\nThings'll go your way\nIf you hold on for one more day: yeah\n\nCan't you change it this time?\nMake up your mind\nHold on: hold on\nBaby: hold on\n\nHold on: hold on\nBaby: hold on",

        "Lyrics": "I could hardly believe it: when I heard the news today\nI had to come and get it straight from you\nThey said you were leavin': someone's swept your heart away\nFrom the look upon your face I see it's true\n\nSo tell me all about it: tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'\nOh: then tell me one thing more before I go\n\nTell me how am I supposed to live without you\nNow that I've been loving you so long\nHow am I supposed to live without you\nAnd how am I supposed to carry on\nWhen all that I've been livin' for is gone\n\nI'm too proud for cryin': didn't come here to break down\nIt's just a dream of mine is coming to an end\nAnd how can I blame you when I built my world around\nThe hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?\n\nAnd I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming\nOh: even now it's more than I can take\n\nTell me how am I supposed to live without you\nNow that I've been loving you so long\nHow am I supposed to live without you\nAnd how am I supposed to carry on\nWhen all that I've been livin' for is gone\n\nNow I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming\nOh: now that your dream has come true\n\nTell me how am I supposed to live without you\nNow that I've been loving you so long\nHow am I supposed to live without you\nAnd how am I supposed to carry on\nWhen all that I've been livin' for is gone\n\nOh: without you\nNow that I've been loving you so long\nHow am I supposed to live without you\nAnd how am I supposed to carry on\nWhen all that I've been livin' for is gone",

        "Lyrics": "It was a rainy night\nWhen he came into sight\nStanding by the road\nWith no umbrella: no coat\n\nSo I pulled up along side\nAnd I offered him a ride\nHe accepted with a smile\nSo we drove for a while\n\nI didn't ask him his name\nThis lonely boy in the rain\nFate: tell me it's right\nIs this love at first sight?\nPlease don't make it wrong\nJust stay for a night\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nSay you will: you want me too\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI got loving arms to hold onto\n\nSo we found this hotel\nIt was a place I knew well\nWe made magic that night\nOh: he did everything right\n\nHe brought the woman out of me\nSo many times: easily\nAnd in the morning: when he woke\nAll I left him was a note\n\nI told him I am the flower\nYou are the seed\nWe walked in the garden\nWe planted a tree\n\nDon't try to find me\nPlease don't you dare\nJust live in my memory\nYou'll always be there\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nI got loving arms to hold onto\n\nWhoa: oh: we made love\nLove like strangers\nAll night long\nWe made love\n\nThen it happened one day\nWe came 'round the same way\nYou can imagine his surprise\nWhen he saw his own eyes\n\nI said: \"Please: please understand\nI'm in love with another man\nAnd what he couldn't give me: oh: whoa\nWas the one little thing that you can\"\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nCome on: say you will: you want me too\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nSay you will: baby: want me too\n\nAll night long: all night long\nAll night long: all night long\n\nAll I wanna do: all I wanna do\nAll I wanna do: all I wanna do\n\nAll I wanna do is make love to you\nOne night of love was all we knew",

        "Lyrics": "Outside another yellow moon\nHas punched a hole in the night time mist\nI climb through the window and down to the street\nI'm shining like a new dime\n\nThe downtown trains are full\nFull of all them Brooklyn girls\nThey try so hard to break out of their little worlds\n\nYou wave your hand and they scatter like crows\nThey have nothing that'll ever capture your heart\nThey're just thorns without the rose\nBe careful of them in the dark\n\nOh if I was the one\nYou chose to be your only one: oh baby\nCan't you hear me now: can't you hear me now\n\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train?\nEvery night: every night is just the same\nOn a downtown train\n\nI know your window and I know it's late\nI know your stairs and your doorway\nI walk down your street and past your gate\nI stand by the light of the four way\n\nAnd watch them as they fall: oh baby\nThey all having their heart attacks\nThey stay at the carnival\nBut they'll never win you back\n\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train?\nEvery night: every night its just the same\nYou leave me lonely\n\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train\nAll my dreams: all my dreams fall like rain\nOn a downtown train\n\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train?\nEvery night: every night its just the same\n\nWill I see you tonight on a downtown train?\nAll my dreams: all my dreams fall like rain\nOn a downtown train\nOn a downtown train\nAll my dreams fall like rain\nOn a downtown train\nOoh",

Yo: I don't know\nTurn off the lights and I'll glow\nTo the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal\nLight up a stage and wax a chump like a candle\n\nDance! Go rush the speaker that booms\nI'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom\nDeadly when I play a dope melody\nAnything less than the best is a felony\n\nLove it or leave it: you better gangway\nYou better hit bullseye: the kid don't play\nIf there was a problem: yo: I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\n\nIce Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla)\n\nNow that the party is jumping\nWith the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'\nQuick to the point: to the point no faking\nI'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon\n\nBurning 'em if they're not quick and nimble\nI go crazy when I hear a cymbal\nAnd a hi-hat with a souped up tempo\nI'm on a roll: it's time to go solo\n\nRollin' in my 5.0\nWith my ragtop down so my hair can blow\nThe girlies on standby waving just to say: \"hi\"\nDid you stop? No: I just drove by\n\nKept on pursuing to the next stop\nI busted a left and I'm heading to the next block\nThat block was dead: yo\nSo: I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue\n\nGirls were hot: wearing less than bikinis\nRockman lovers driving Lamborghinis\nJealous: 'cause I'm out getting mine\nShay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine\n\nReady for the chumps on the wall\nThe chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball\nGunshots ranged out like a bell\nI grabbed my nine: all I heard were shells\n\nFallin' on the concrete real fast\nJumped in my car: slammed on the gas\nBumper to bumper: the avenue's packed\nI'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack\n\nPolice on the scene: you know what I mean?\nThey passed me up: confronted all the dope fiends\nIf there was a problem: yo: I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\n\nIce Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n\nTake heed: 'cause I'm a lyrical poet\nMiami's on the scene: just in case you didn't know it\nMy town that created all the bass sound\nEnough to shake and kick holes in the ground\n\n'Cause my style's like a chemical spill\nFeasible rhymes that you can vision and feel\nConducted and formed: this is a hell of a concept\nWe make it hype and you want to step with this\n\nShay plays on the fade: slice like a ninja\nCut like a razor blade\nSo fast: other DJs say: \"Damn\"\nIf my rhyme was a drug: I'd sell it by the gram\n\nKeep my composure when it's time to get loose\nMagnetized by the mic while I kick my juice\nIf there was a problem: yo: I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while D-Shay revolves it\n\nIce Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby\n(Vanilla) Ice\n\nYo man: let's get out of here\nWord to your mother\n\nIce Ice Baby too cold\nIce Ice Baby too cold: too cold\nIce Ice Baby too cold: too cold\nIce Ice Baby too cold: too cold",

(gotta blame it on something)\nGotta blame it on something...\n\n(Blame it on the rain) that was fallin' fallin'...\n(Blame it on the stars) that did shine at night...\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you...\nBlame it on the rain... (yeah yeah)\nYou can blame it on the rain...\n\nShould've told her you were sorry... (sorry)\nCould have said you were wrong...\nBut no you couldn't do that...\nYou had to prove you were strong...\nOoh if you hadn't been so blinded... (blinded)\n\nShe might still be there with you...\nYou want her back again...\nBut she just don't feel the same...\nGotta blame it on something... (gotta blame it on something)\nGotta blame it on something...\n\n(Blame it on the rain) that was fallin' fallin'...\n(Blame it on the stars) that did shine at night...\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you...\nBlame it on the rain... (yeah yeah)\n\nGo on and blame it on the rain...\n'Cause the rain don't mind\nAnd the rain don't care\nYou got to blame it on something\n\n(Blame it on the rain) that was fallin' fallin'...\n(Blame it on the stars) that did shine at night...\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you...\nBlame it on the rain... (yeah yeah)\nYou can blame it on the rain\n\n(Blame it on the rain yeah: yeah)\n(Blame it on the rain yeah: yeah)\n(Blame it on the rain yeah: yeah)\n\nYou can blame it on the rain:\nBlame it on the rain:\nBlame it on the rain baby\n(Blame it on the rain yeah yeah)\n\nBlame it on the stars that did shine that night\n(Blame it on the rain yeah yeah)\nBlame it: blame it on the rain\nWoo\n\nI'm walking\nI'm walking\nWalking in the rain\nWalking in the rain\n\n(Rain: rain)\n(Stars: stars)\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you\n(Blame it on the rain)\nYeah yeah\n\n(Blame it on the rain)\nThat keeps falling: falling\n(Blame it on the stars)\nThat did shine that night\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you\nBlame it on the rain yeah yeah\nBlame it on the rain (rain: rain)",

I like my oatmeal lumpy.\nI'm sick wit dis: straight gangsta mack\nBut sometimes I get ridiculous\nI'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice\nHey yo fat girl: c'mere--are ya ticklish?\nYeah: I called ya fat.\nLook at me: I'm skinny\nIt never stopped me from gettin' busy\nI'm a freak\nI like the girls with the boom\nI once got busy in a Burger King bathroom\nI'm crazy.\nAllow me to amaze thee.\nThey say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.\nI'm still gettin' in the girls' pants\nAnd I even got my own dance\n\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doin': doin' the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\n\nPeople say \"Yo: Humpty: you're really funny lookin\"\nThat's all right 'cause I get things cookin'\nYa stare: ya glare: ya constantly try to compare me\nBut ya can't get near me\nI give 'em more: see: and on the floor: B:\nAll the girls they adore me\nOh yes: ladies: I'm really bein' sincere\n'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.\nMy nose is big: uh-uh I'm not ashamed\nBig like a pickle: I'm still gettin' paid\nI get laid by the ladies: ya know I'm in charge:\nBoth how I'm livin' and my nose is large\nI get stupid: I shoot an arrow like Cupid:\nI use a word that don't mean nothin': like looptid\nI sang on Doowhutchalike: and if ya missed it:\nI'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits\nAlso told ya that I like to bite\nWell: yeah: I guess it's obvious: I also like to write.\nAll ya had to do was give Humpty a chance\nAnd now I'm gonna do my dance.\n\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doin': doin' the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\n\nOh: yeah: that's the break: y'all\nLet me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here\nOh: yeah!\nNow that I told ya a little bit about myself\nLet me tell ya a little bit about this dance\nIt's real easy to do--check it out\n\nFirst I limp to the side like my leg was broken\nShakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'\nCrazy wack funky\nPeople say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack: Humpty\nThat's all right 'cause my body's in motion\nIt's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion\nAnyone can play this game\nThis is my dance: y'all: Humpty Hump's my name\nNo two people will do it the same\nYa got it down when ya appear to be in pain\nHumpin': funkin': jumpin':\nJig around: shakin' ya rump:\nAnd when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump\nTell him step off: I'm doin' the Hump.\n\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doin': doin' the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\n\nBlack people: do the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\nWhite people: do the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\nPuerto Ricans: do the Humpty Hump: just keep on doin' the hump\nSamoans: do the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\n\nLet's get stupid!\n\nThe Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: come on and do the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: just watch me do the Humpty Hump\nDo ya know what I'm doin': doin' the Humpty Hump\nDo the Humpty Hump: do the Humpty Hump\n\nOh: yeah: come on and break it down\n\nOnce again: the Underground is in the house\nI'd like to send a shout out to the whole world:\nKeep on doin' the Humpty Dance:\nAnd to the ladies:\nPeace and humptiness forever",

        "Lyrics": "The game of love is to live it up\nAnd baby not too high.\nDon't you know: if you wanna get down with Mister P\nYou gotta go and let your backbone slide.\nWhat feeling when you push it up: push it down.\nYou gotta push it up: push it down. Feel good.\nGeorge Michael or Marvin Gaye\nIt still is the same in you.\nBaby don't tease. Ooh: just please\n'Cause you know it's just me and you.\nAll or nothing: push: it's got to be.\nSomething's gotta show when you're livin' under heat.\nAll or nothing: push: girl: let it be.\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat.\nI'm under heat oh baby: please take it slow.\nGive me some time and maybe: our love will grow.\nI want to suit you baby and make it right.\nTake it from me babe: I wanna rock all night.\nIf it's good for me: it's good for you.\nYou gotta never let your mood get dry.\nJust keep it wet and my seven forty jet\nIs pushing right on high.\nGeorge Michael or Marvin Gaye\nIt still is the same in you.\nBaby don't tease. Ooh: just please\n'Cause you know it's just me and you.\nAll or nothing: push: it's got to be.\nSomething's gotta show when you're livin' under heat.\nAll or nothing: push: girl: let it be.\nTake it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat.\nI'm under heat oh baby: please take it slow.\nGive me some time and maybe: our love will grow.\nI want to suit you baby and make it right.\nTake it from me babe: I wanna rock all night.\nPush it up: push it down.\nPush it where it feels real good.\nOn my lips my sweet bumble bee.\nSting me like I knew you could.\nAll or nothing: push: it's got to be.\nSomething's gotta show when you're lyin' under me.\nOh: oh: nothin' girl: let it be.\nTake it from the pro: who's rockin' to the beat.",

        "Lyrics": "Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date\nBut a year to make love: she wanted you to wait?\nLet me tell ya a story of my situation\nI was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation\nThe way that I met her was on tour at a concert\nShe had long hair and a short miniskirt\nI just got onstage drippin': pourin' with sweat\nI was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met\nI whispered in her ear: 'Come to the picture booth\nSo I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof'\nI asked her her name: she said 'blah-blah-blah'\nShe had 9/10 pants and a very big bra\nI took a couple of flicks and she was enthused\nI said: 'How do you like the show?'\nShe said: 'I was very amused'\nI started throwin' bass: she started throwin' back mid-range\nBut when I sprung the question: she acted kind of strange\nThen when I asked: 'Do ya have a man?' she tried to pretend\nShe said: 'No I don't: I only have a friend'\nCome on: I'm not even goin' for it\nThis is what I'm goin' sing\n\nYou: you got what I need but you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend: oh baby\nYou: you got what I need but you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend: oh baby\nYou: you got what I need but you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend\n\nSo I took blah-blah's word for it at this time\nI thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime\n'Cause I have friends and that's a fact\nLike Agnes: Agatha: Germaine: and Jacq\nForget about that: let's go into the story\nAbout a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me\nSo we started talkin': getttin' familiar\nSpendin' a lot of time so we can build up\nA relationship or some understanding\nHow it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'\nEverything sounded so dandy and sweet\nI had no idea I was in for a treat\nAfter this was established: everything was cool\nThe tour was over and she went back to school\nI called every day to see how she was doin'\nEverytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'\nI called her room: a guy picked up: and then I called again\nI said: 'Yo: who was that?' 'Oh: he's just a friend'\nDon't gimme that: don't ever gimme that\nJus' bust this\n\nYou: you got what I need but you say he's just a friend\nAnd you say he's just a friend: oh baby\nYou: you got what I need but you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend: oh baby\nYou: you got what I need but you say he's just a friend\nBut you say he's just a friend\n\nSo I came to her college on a surprise visit\nTo see my girl that was so exquisite\nIt was a school day: I knew she was there\nThe first semester of the school year\nI went to a gate to ask where was her dorm\nThis guy made me fill out a visitor's form\nHe told me where it was and I was on my way\nTo see my baby doll: I was happy to say\nI arrived in front of the dormitory\n'Yo: could you tell me where is door three?'\nThey showed me where it was for the moment\nI didn't know I was in for such an event\nSo I came to her room and opened the door\nOh: snap! Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth:\nI was so in shock my heart went down south\nSo please listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend\nAy boi",

What are you telling me?\nWhat are you telling me? What are you telling me?\n\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nI don't have any ifs: I am positive\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nWere never gonna be alone: our love is stone\n\nToo many words are too much a crowd\nI wanna spill 'em or they'll leak out\nI'm so glad to get the chance\nI kept it secret till I knew for sure\nSo not to pick my heart off the floor\nNow it's time to take a stand: heart in hand\n\nWhispers in the dark don't do: let's hit the lights\nNow I just got to spread the news\nSo what are you telling me? What are you telling me?\nWhat are you telling me? What are you telling me?\n\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nWhen I drop a tear you are always here\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nI'm look at a living dream: don't wake me up\n\nDon't stop: love me till you drop: it's alright with me\nOne sharp arrow through the heart: it's alright: it's alright\nNow whistle\n\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nI will never give you up\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nYou're my one and only love\n\nWhispers in the dark don't do: let's hit the lights\nNow I just got to spread the news\nSo what are you telling me now? What are you telling me?\nWhat are you telling me? What are you telling me?\nWhat are you telling me: now?\n\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nI wanna tell the everybody you're my cup of tea\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nYour love never shakes: you don't alternate\n\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nSmoke gets in my eyes: I don't see other guys\nI wanna tell the whole wide world about you\nOur love will never tumble down: it's built on solid ground",

        "Lyrics": "Love come quick\nLove come in a hurry\nThere's thieves in the temple tonight\nThey don't care where they kick\nJust as long as they hurt you\nThey're thieves in the temple tonight\n\nLove: if you're there come save me\nFrom all this cold despair\nI can hang when you're around\nBut I'll surely die if you're not there\n\nLove come quick\nLove come in a hurry\nThey're thieves in the temple tonight\n\nI feel like I'm looking for my soul\nLike a poor man looking for gold\nThey're thieves in the temple tonight\n\nVoices from the sky say\nRely on your best friend to pull you through\nBut even if I wanted to: I couldn't really truly\nBecause my only friend is you: ooh ooh ooh ooh\nCome on\n\nThey're thieves in the temple tonight\nKicking me in my heart\nTearing me: tearing me: tearing me: tearing me all apart\nBecause me and you could've been a work of art\n(Thieves in the temple)\n\nBaby: don't you know I'm holding on the best that I can\nLove please help me be a better man\nBetter than the thieves in the temple: in the temple tonight\nOh: thieves in the temple tonight (hurt me)\n\nLove come quick\nLove come in a hurry\nThey're thieves in the temple tonight\n\n(Thieves in the temple) \"You said you loved me!\"\n(Thieves in the temple) \"You said I was your man!\"\n(Thieves in the temple)\n(Love come quick) \"But they were lies!\"\n(Love come in a hurry) \"Lies!\"\n(Thieves in the temple tonight)\n\"Ah!\"",

No te vayas! Yo te necesito!)\nToday you tell me something y ma&#xF1;ana es otra cosa\n(Tsk! But?!)\nMentirosa!\n\nAin't got nobody...",

        "Lyrics": "Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play\nWhen I was little I used to say\nI got the X and I got the O\nIt don't matter 'cause it's Tic Tac Toe\n\nNow I'm a little bit older\nI like to play just a little bit bolder\nI like gettin' girls and givin' 'em pearls\nAnd their legs across my shoulders\n\nI love to go to the disco\nSee a fly girl and say hello\nThey just look me in the eye and pass right by\nWith that booty shakin' like Jello\n\nI like to speak 'cause that's bein' nice\nIt makes me mad when I have to speak twice\nBut that's the game that girls like to play\nIt's just Tic Tac Toe and roll the other way\n\nX and O: as in yes and no\nX and O: as in sex: maybe so\nX is for yes and O is for no\nX is for sex or maybe so\n\nYou might get some if you play this game\nAll girls love it but smooth is their game\n\nThat's why they just walk right by\nLaughin': gigglin': shakin' that pie\nGirls are what you what when you come up to them\nSo don't play dumb and try to school 'em\n\nThat's when you got to be real cool\nJump in the biz and act a fool\nPull out the portable car phone\nNext thing you know you'll be drivin' 'em home\n\nOn the way there you're thinkin' 'bout one thing\nGirls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing\nYou through the X and go for the kiss\nThey throw the O and go for the dis\n\nX and O: as in yes and no\nX and O: as in sex: maybe so\nX is for yes and O is for no\nX is for sex or maybe so\n\nYou might get some if you play this game\nAll girls love it but smooth is their game\n\nDo you wanna play Tic Tac Toe?\nDo you wanna play Tic Tac Toe?\nDo you wanna play Tic Tac Toe?\nDo you wanna play Tic Tac Toe?\n\nX and O: as in yes and no\nX and O: as in sex: maybe so\nX is for yes and O is for no\nX is for sex or maybe so\n\nYou might get some if you play this game\nAll girls love it but smooth is their game\n\nI met this girl by the name of Judy\nKind of cute with a real nice booty\nHard to get and likes to play tough\n'Cause she knows I want the funky stuff\n\nWhen I spoke: she wouldn't even speak\nTill she saw me in the biz that week\nTook her to the movies and bought her a treat\nWent to my house and made the bed squeak\n\nYeah: that Judy puts up a fight\nBut I won with the X 'cause I rolled that night\nJust when things started to feel good\nWe rolled a little fast and we broke the wood\n\nMy dad got up 'cause he heard some knockin'\nThought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'\nCame to my room opened up the door\nSon whatcha doin'? Playin' Tic Tac Toe\n\nX and O: as in yes and no\nX and O: as in sex: maybe so\nX is for yes and O is for no\nX is for sex or maybe so\n\nYou might get some if you play this game\nAll girls love it but smooth is their game",
