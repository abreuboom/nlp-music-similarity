By golly: it's clean clear to Flag Town: c'mon. Yeah: that's a big 10-4 there: Pig Pen: yeah: we definitely got the front door: good buddy. Mercy sakes alive: looks like we got us a convoy... \n\nWas the dark of the moon on the sixth of June\nIn a Kenworth pullin' logs\nCab-over Pete with a reefer on\nAnd a Jimmy haulin' hogs\n\nWe is headin' for bear on I-10\n'Bout a mile outta Shaky Town\nI says: \"Pig Pen: this here's the Rubber Duck.\"\n\"And I'm about to put the hammer down.\"\n\n'Cause we got a little convoy\nRockin' through the night\nYeah: we got a little convoy\nAin't she a beautiful sight?\n\nCome on and join our convoy\nAin't nothin' gonna get in our way\nWe gonna roll this truckin' convoy\n'Cross the USA: convoy\n\nAh: breaker: Pig Pen: this here's the Duck. And: you wanna back off them hogs? Yeah: 10-4: 'bout five mile or so. Ten: roger. Them hogs is gettin' in-tense up here. \n\nBy the time we got into Tulsa Town\nWe had eighty-five trucks in all\nBut they's a roadblock up on the cloverleaf\nAnd them bears was wall-to-wall\n\nYeah: them smokies is thick as bugs on a bumper\nThey even had a bear in the air\nI says: \"Callin' all trucks: this here's the Duck.\nWe about to go a-huntin' bear.\"\n\n'Cause we got a great big convoy\nRockin' through the night\nYeah: we got a great big convoy\nAin't she a beautiful sight?\n\nCome on and join our convoy\nAin't nothin' gonna get in our way\nWe gonna roll this truckin' convoy\n'Cross the USA: convoy\n\nAh: you wanna give me a 10-9 on that: Pig Pen? Negatory: Pig Pen; you're still too close. Yeah: them hogs is startin' to close up my sinuses. Mercy sakes: you better back off another ten. \n\nWell: we rolled up Interstate 44\nLike a rocket sled on rails\nWe tore up all of our swindle sheets\nAnd left 'em settin' on the scales\n\nBy the time we hit that Chi-town\nThem bears was a-gettin' smart\nThey'd brought up some reinforcements\nFrom the Illinois National Guard\n\nThere's armored cars and tanks and jeeps\nAnd rigs of ev'ry size\nYeah: them chicken coops was full'a bears\nAnd choppers filled the skies\n\nWell: we shot the line and we went for broke\nWith a thousand screamin' trucks\nAn' eleven long-haired Friends a' Jesus\nIn a chartreuse micra-bus\n\nAh: Rubber Duck to Sodbuster: come over. Yeah: 10-4: Sodbuster? Lissen: you wanna put that micra-bus right behind that suicide jockey? Yeah: he's haulin' dynamite: and he needs all the help he can get. \n\nWell: we laid a strip for the Jersey shore\nAnd prepared to cross the line\nI could see the bridge was lined with bears\nBut I didn't have a dog-goned dime\n\nI says: \"Pig Pen: this here's the Rubber Duck.\nWe just ain't a-gonna pay no toll.\"\nSo we crashed the gate doing ninety-eight\nI says \"Let them truckers roll: 10-4.\"\n\n'Cause we got a mighty convoy\nRockin' through the night\nYeah: we got a mighty convoy\nAin't she a beautiful sight?\n\nCome on and join our convoy\nAin't nothin' gonna get in our way\nWe gonna roll this truckin' convoy\n'Cross the USA\n\nConvoy! Ah: 10-4: Pig Pen: what's your twenty? \nConvoy! Omaha? Well: they oughta know what to do with them hogs out there fer shure. Well: mercy \nConvoy! sakes: good buddy: we gonna back on outta here: so keep the bugs off your glass and the bears off your...  \nConvoy! tail. We'll catch you on the flip-flop. This here's the Rubber Duck on the side. \nConvoy! We gone. 'Bye:'bye.",
