        "Lyrics": "I can feel the magic floating in the air\nBeing with you gets me that way\nI watch the sunlight dance across your face\nAnd I've never been this swept away\nAll my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze\nWhen I'm lying wrapped up in your arms\nThe whole world just fades away\nThe only thing I hear is the beating of your heart\n\n'Cause I can feel you breathe\nIt's washing over me\nAnd suddenly I'm melting into you\nThere's nothing left to prove\nBaby: all we need is just to be\nCaught up in the touch\nSlow and steady rush\nBaby: isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?\nI can feel you breathe\nJust breathe\n\nIn a way I know my heart is waking up\nAs all the walls come tumbling down\nCloser than I've ever felt before\nAnd I know: and you know\nThere's no need for words right now\n\n'Cause I can feel you breathe\nIt's washing over me\nAnd suddenly I'm melting into you\nThere's nothing left to prove\nBaby: all we need is just to be\nCaught up in the touch\nSlow and steady rush\nBaby: isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?\nI can feel you breathe\nJust breathe\n\nCaught up in the touch\nSlow and steady rush\nBaby: isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?\nI can feel you breathe: just breathe\nI can feel the magic floating in the air\nBeing with you gets me that way",

(Tell me why)\nTell me why I can't be there where you are\nThere's something missing in my heart\n\nThere's nowhere to run: I have no place to go\nSurrender my heart: body: and soul\nHow can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show?\n\nYou are missing in my heart\nTell me why I cannot be there where you are?\n\nShow me the meaning of being lonely\nIs this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)\nTell me why I can't be there where you are (Where you are)\nThere's something missing in my heart (You are missing in my heart)\n\nShow me the meaning of being lonely (Being lonely)\nIs this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)\nTell me why I can't be there where you are (Can't be there where you are)\nThere's something missing in my heart",

sing the chorus: and it goes\n\nI'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\n'Cause Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\nWill Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records\nWell I do: so fuck him and fuck you: too\nYou think I give a damn about a Grammy?\nHalf o' you critics can't even stomach me: let alone stand me\n\n\"But Slim: what if you win: wouldn't it be weird?\"\nWhy: so you guys can just lie to get me here?\nSo you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?\nYo shit: Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs\n\nSo I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst\nAnd hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\nLittle bitch put me on blast on MTV\n\"Yeah he's cute: but I think he's married to Kim: hehe\"\n\nI should download her audio on MP3\nAnd show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)\nI'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me\nSo I have been sent here to destroy you\n\nAnd there's a million of us just like me\nWho cuss like me: who just don't give a fuck like me\nWho dress like me: walk: talk: and act like me\nAnd just might be the next best thing but not quite me\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\nI'm like a head trip to listen to: 'cause I'm only giving you\nThings you joke about with your friends: inside your livin' room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all\nAnd I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all\n\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it (rip): I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums\n\nIt's funny: 'cause at the rate I'm going: when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting\nPinchin' nurses asses: while I'm jackin' off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerkin': but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'\n\nIn every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'\nWho could be workin' at Burger King: spittin' on your onion rings\nOr in the parking lot circling: screamin' \"I don't give a fuck\"\nWith his windows down and his system up\n\nSo will the real Shady please stand up\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time: loud as you can: how does it go?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\nI'm Slim Shady: yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up: please stand up?\n\nHaha: guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us\nFuck it: let's all stand up",

Ah... ah..)\n\nUh...\n\nI was a girl about the floss;\nIt was all about the cost:\nHow much he spent on me.\n\nSeek for a man who's got the means\nTo be giving you diamond rings:\nIt's what every fly girl\nCould want or even dream.\n\nBut I'm not every girl:\nAnd I don't need no G\nTo take care of me.\n\n'Cause shorty got a job:\nShorty got a car:\nShorty can pay her own rent.\nDon't wanna dance if\nIt's not in my heart.\nNo: oh.\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling:\nGot my own thing:\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green:\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of:\nA man that understands real love.\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling:\nGot my own thing\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green:\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of:\nA man that understands real love...\n\n(Uh-uh: uh-uh)\n(Yeah...)\n(Oh: yeah...)\n\nI'm not every girl:\nAnd I don't need no G\nTo take care of me: no.\n\n'Cause shorty got a job:\nShorty got a car:\nShorty can pay her own rent:\nDon't wanna dance if\nIt's not in my heart...\n\nBut I'm not every girl:\nAnd I don't need no G\nTo take care of me.\n\nNo: shorty got a job:\nShorty got a car:\nShorty can pay her own rent:\nDon't wanna dance if\nIt's not in my heart...\nOh: no.\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling:\nGot my own thing:\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green:\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of:\nA man that understands real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the bling-bling:\nGot my own thing\nGot the ching-ching.\nI just want real love...\n\nMost girls want a man\nWith the mean green:\nDon't wanna dance\nIf he can't be\nEverything that I dream of:\nA man that understands real love...",

Shit I...\nParts with nothin': y'all be frontin\nMe give my heart to a woman?\nNot for nothin': never happen\nI'll be forever mackin\nHeart cold as assassins: I got no passion\nI got no patience\nAnd I hate waitin...\nHoe get yo' ass in\nAnd let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE... check 'em out now\nRI-I-I-I-I-IDE: yeah\nAnd let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE... check 'em out now\nRI-I-I-I-I-IDE: yeah\n\nWe doin'... big pimpin': we spendin cheese\nCheck 'em out now\nBig pimpin': on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe doin'... big pimpin' up in N.Y.C.\nIt's just that Jigga Man: Pimp C: and B-U-N B\nYo yo yo... big pimpin': spendin cheese\nWe doin' - big pimpin': on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe doin'... big pimpin' up in N.Y.C.\nIt's just that Jigga Man: Pimp C: and B-U-N B\n\nBun B\nNigga it's the - big Southern rap impresario\nComin' straight up out the black bar-rio\nMakes a mill' up off a sorry hoe\nThen sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh\nOops: my bad: that's my scenario\nNo I can't fuck a scary hoe\nNow every time: every place: everywhere we go\nHoes start pointin - they say: \"There he go!\"\nNow these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit\nWe don't pull it out over little shit\nAnd if you catch a lick when I spit: then it won't be a little hit\nGo read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab\nDon't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me\nAnd you see us comin' down on yo' slab\nLivin' ghetto-fabulous: so mad: you just can't take it\nBut nigga if you hatin' I\nThen you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked: just break it\nYou gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on\nNow get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin to the track\nTimbaland let me spit my pro's on\nPump it up in the pro-zone\nThat's the track that we breakin these hoes on\nAin't the track that we flow's on\nBut when shit get hot: then the glock start poppin' like ozone\nWe keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man\nFo' real it don't get no bigger man\nDon't trip: let's flip: gettin' throwed on the flip\nGettin' blowed with the motherfuckin Jigga Man: fool\n\nWe be... big pimpin': spendin cheese\nWe be... big pimpin': on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe be... big pimpin' down in P.A.T.\nIt's just that Jigga Man: Pimp C: and B-U-N B\n'Cause we be... big pimpin': spendin cheese\nAnd we be... big pimpin': on B.L.A.D.'s\n'Cause we be... big pimpin' in P.A.T.\nIt's just that Jigga Man: Pimp C: and B-U-N B... nigga\n\nPimp C\nUh... smokin' out: throwin' up: keepin' lean up in my cup\nAll my car got leather and wood: in my hood we call it buck\nEverybody wanna ball: holla at broads at the mall\nIf he up: watch him fall: nigga I can't fuck witch'all\nIf I wasn't rappin' baby: I would still be ridin' Mercedes\nChromin shinin sippin daily: no rest until whitey pay me\nUh: now what y'all know 'bout them Texas boys\nComin' down in candied toys: smokin' weed and talkin' noise",

Bitch: I ain't trippin'\nI'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg\nDrinkin' Henn and actin' like it do somethin' to me\nHope this indecent proposal make you do somethin' with me\nFuck a dollar girl: pick up fifty\nAnd fuck that coward you need a real nigga\nOff top knick-a-boxers hurtin' shit\nBend over hoe; show me what you workin with!\n\nAttention all y'all players and pimps\nRight now in the place to be (shake ya ass)\nI thought I told y'all niggas before\nY'all niggas can't fuck with me (watch yourself)\nNow this ain't fun: no smoke or tease\nNo sir 'cause that won't pass (show me whatcha workin with)\nBut if you feel you got the biggest one\nThen momma come shake ya ass\n\nI like my women fire like CAY-ENNE!\nChocolate and bowlegged - when I'm runnin' up behind her!\nGo head get ya pop-a-lock let the cock out\nFor girl don't lie you know you wanna go back to my house\n\"The Man Right Chea\" wanna get under that dress right there\nYou spicy cajun we gon' a good time over there\nYou better suck the head on them there crawfish\nAnd you gotta bend all the way over to dance off this\nHandle yo' business but I know you do it way better: you dead wrong\nSo if you talkin' bout how niggaz make noise when you pass by\nGet yo' fine ass on the floor girl this yo' fuckin' song!\nDo yo' thang don't be scared: cause you gon' get served\nYou get mine then you gon' get yours\nBout to make yo' ass love it\nRaise it up: show the G-string hustlin hustlin\n\nStop yo' cryin heffer: I don't need all that\nI got a job for you - the braided up pimp is back\nBreak them handcuffs: fuck you nigga move somethin'\nAnd if they ask you what you doin' say: \"Ooh nuttin!\"\nAnd we been doin' for the past 2 somethin'\nAnd I've been beatin' that pussy up now it's smooth fuckin'\nYou can betcha bottom dollar; if that pussy fire\nYou gon' holla Michael Tyler!\nSo don't act like you don't be backin that stuff up\nGirl in the club: cause that's what you got ass for\nWobble wobble I'm infatuated\nBitch ride a dick like she makin' a baby\nAnd I see that we gon' have to go to a quiet corner for just us two an'\nDon't worry about who lookin': just keep on doin' what you doin'\nCause a nigga like me gon' get to work before I know the girl\nBitch what's happnin: let 'em see: show the world!\n\nUh...

(A'ight!)\nThere go the gun click: 9-1-1 shit\nAll over some dumb shit: ain't that some shit\nY'all niggaz remind me of a strip club: cause everytime\nYou come around: it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked\nAnd I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to\nBut I'm not him: aight slim?  So watch what you do\nOr you gon' find yourself: buried next to someone else\nAnd we all thought you loved yourself\nBut that couldn't have been the issue: or maybe\nThey just sayin' that: now cause they miss you\nShit a nigga tried to diss you\nThat's why you layin' on your back: lookin' at the roof of the church\nPreacher tellin' the truth and it hurts: uh\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here: up in here\n\nOff the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain\n'Cause niggas still want the fame: off the name\nFirst of all: you ain't rapped long enough\nTo be fuckin' with me and you: you ain't strong enough\nSo whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman\nI got the Kryptonite: should I smack him with my dick and the mic?\nY'all niggas is characters: not even good actors\nWhat's gon' be the outcome?  Hmm: let's add up all the factors\nYou wack: you're twisted: your girl's a hoe\nYou're broke: the kid ain't yours: and e'rybody know\nYour old man say you stupid: you be like: \"So?\nI love my baby mother: I never let her go\"\nI'm tired of weak ass niggaz whinin' over puss\nThat don't belong to them: fuck is wrong with them?\nThey fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them\nWho get it on on the strength of the hands with them: man\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here: up in here\n\nI bring down rains so heavy it curse the head\nNo more talkin: put him in the dirt instead\nYou keep walkin: lest you trying to end up red\nCause if I end up fed: y'all end up dead\nCause youse a soft type nigga\nFake up North type nigga\nPuss like a soft white nigga\nDog is a dog: blood's thicker than water\nWe done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter\nThe bigger the order: the more guns we brought out\nWe run up in there: e'rybody come out: don't nobody run out\nSun in to sun out: I'ma keep the gun out\nNigga runnin his mouth?  I'ma blow his lung out\nListen: yo' ass is about to be missin'\nYou know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin'\nGrandma wishin' your soul's at rest\nBut it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in here: up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here: up in here\n\n(Shhh!

(That's the way)\nAnd that's the way it is.\n\nOne fine day you wake up:\nCompletely: hoplessly fallin' in love.\nHe's just what you're lookin' for:\nThe only problem is: that the man's not sure.\nAnother guy'll give you everything:\nThe only problem is you don't feel a thing.\nWell I know from experience\nNothin's ever gonna make perfect sense.\nOh: one day you get what you want.\nBut it's not what you think.\nThen you get what you need.\n\nWell: oh: that's the way it is!\nYou gotta roll with the punches.\nThat's the way it goes!\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows.\nYou live you learn:\nYou crash and burn.\nIt's hit or miss. (That's the way)\nAnd that's the way it is.\n\nYeah they say your soul is growin' but:\nSometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'.\n\nAnd that's the way it is.\nYou gotta roll with the punches.\nAnd that's the way it goes.\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows.\nThat's the way it is.\nYou gotta roll with the punches.\nThat's the way it goes.\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows.\nYou live you learn:\nYou crash and burn:\nIt's hit or miss: Oh\nAnd that's the way it is.\n\n\nOh that's the way it is. Yeah.\nThat's the way it is.\nThat's the way it is.\nYou gotta roll with the punches.\nOh. You gotta bend when the wind blows.\nOh. That's the way it goes.\nThat's the way it is.\nThat's the way it goes. Oh: yeah.\nYou gotta roll with the punches.",

Give our love a chance for one more day\"\nWe could have worked things out\nTaking time is what love's all about\n\nBut you put a dart\nThrough my dreams\nThrough my heart\nAnd I'm back where I started again\nNever thought it would end\n\nYou promised yourself\nBut to somebody else\nAnd you made it so perfectly clear\nStill I wish you were here now...\n\n\"Never look back:\" we said\nHow was I to know I'd miss you so?",

Do I stay? Do I go?\nThink about my life and what matters to me the most\nGirl: the love that we share is real\nBut in time your heart will heal\nI'm not saying I'm gone but I\nHave to find what life is like without you",

        "Lyrics": "I was always the crazy one\nWho broke into the stadium\nAnd I wrote your number\nOn the fifty yard line\nYou were always the perfect one\nAnd a valedictorian\nSo under your number I wrote\nCall for a good time\nI only wanted to get your attention\nBut you over looked me somehow\nBesides you had too many boyfriends to mention\nAnd I played my guitar too loud\n\nHow do you like me now?\nHow do you like me now?\nNow that I'm on my way\nDo you still think I'm crazy standing here today?\nI couldn't make you love me\nBut I always dreamed about living in your radio\nHow do you like me now?!\n\nWhen I took off to Tennessee\nI heard that you made fun of me\nYou never imagined I'd make it this far\nThen you married into the money girl\nAin't it a cruel and funny world\nHe took your dreams and he tore them apart\nHe never comes home and you're always alone\nAnd your kids hear you cry down the hall\nAlarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'\nIt's me baby with your wake up call\n\nHow do you like me now?\nHow do you like me now?\nNow that I'm on my way\nDo you still think I'm crazy standing here today?\nI couldn't make you love me\nBut I always dreamed about living in your radio\nHow do you like me now?!\n \nHow do you like me now?\nNow that I'm on my way\nDo you still think I'm crazy standing here today?\nI couldn't make you love me\nBut I always dreamed about living in your radio\nHow do you like me now?!\n\nTell me baby!\nI will preach on!

(Can you tell me: baby)\nWhy? How? All night long\n(All night long)\n\n(Da Brat)\nI like 'em brown: yellow: Puerto Rican or Haitian with\nGood conversation plenty big faces\nIt's a must I stay luxurious\nJewelry cut precision like I bust\nBeen winnin' since Funkdafied blew up\nIt's evident: shit I can't be touched\nNiggas say I'm too much: I trust it's true\nWhy lie? See for yourself when I slide through\nDrive by: your bitch say don't look: you do\nShine so bright in the wet U2\nYou wish boo boo could ride with you tonight\nAin't nothing in the world that Brat can't do\nShe attractive to them: him: her: and you shit\nFrostbit: December Unrestricted\nDrop dead: the cost is priceless\nDue to the content I suggest you'll like this\n\n1 - \nWhat do you like?\nA whole lot of foreplay\nRight before you get it started\nWhat do you like?\nMe on top\nYou on the bottom: tight body\nWhat do you like?\nSomebody that can make you say\nWow: oh wow: all night long\nAll night long: tell me\n\n(Da Brat)\nWhassup? The setting: a hot-ass club\nAnd you still be sweating me\nI don't see nothing wrong with giving a little love\nBut nigga just let me breathe\nDamn: you cute as hell so let's switch the digits\nThen I got to leave\nAnd you can buy me a couple of drinks\nBut I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed\nAnd I like it when you keep your eyes on me\nAnd I like it when you touch my privacy\nAnd I like it sex and ecstasy\nWhen the belt buckle loosen up: undress me\nAlready juiced up: that come naturally\nWax on and off so romantically\nNo woman can slow dance or throw down like I can\nAsk if you curious to know what I like: man\n\n(Da Brat)\nLet me tell you something\nWell I start at the top of the list\nWith my pretty eyes: a cute nose and these fat ass lips\nMy medallion sit in the middle of my tits\nIt's hit after hit: shit sweet every sip\nDown to the last drip drop: watch the hips rock\nColor Me Bad: tick tock you don't stop\nTill the thick thighs: dick rise when I skip by\nI ain't surprised I'm what'chu like nigga\n\nRepeat 1 until fade",
