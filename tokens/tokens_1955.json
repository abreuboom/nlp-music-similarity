        "Lyrics": "It's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nWhen your true lover comes your way\nIt's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nIt's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nWhen your true lover comes your way\nIt's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nThe poets say\n\nThe story goes that once a cherry tree\nBeside an apple tree did grow\nAnd there a boy once met his bride to be\nLong long ago\n\nThe boy looked into her eyes: it was a sight to enthrall\nThe breezes joined in their sighs: the blossoms started to fall\nAnd as they gently carressed: the lovers looked up to find\nThe branches of the two trees were intertwined\n\nAnd that is why the poets always write\nIf there's a new moon bright above\nIt's cherry pink and apple blossom white\nWhen you're in love",

Me: oh my: oh what a girl\n\nYou should see how she carries on with her admirants galore\nShe must be giving them quite a thrill: the way they flock to her door\nShe throws those \"come hither\" glances at every Tom: Dick and Joe\nWhen offered some liquid refreshment: the lady never: never says: \"No\"\n\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane. Me: oh my: oh what a girl\n\nThe things they're trying to pin on her won't hold much water: I'm sure\nBeneath the powder and fancy lace: there beats a heart sweet and pure\nShe just needs someone to change her and she'll be nice as can be\nIf you're in the neighbourhood: stranger: you're welcome to drop in and see\n\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane: so delightful to hold\nThe naughty lady of Shady Lane. So delectable: quite respectable\n\nAnd she's only nine days old",
