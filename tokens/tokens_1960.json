        "Lyrics": "In May of 1941 the war had just begun\nThe Germans had the biggest ships that had the biggest guns\nThe Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas\nOn her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees\n\nOut of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood\nAnd ev'ry British seaman he knew and understood\nThey had to sink the Bismark: the terror of the sea\nStop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees\n\nWe'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss\nWe gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us\nHit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around\nWhen we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down\n\nThe Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day\nThe Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away\nWe gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound\nBut when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down\n\nFor six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail\nChurchill told the people put ev'ry ship a-sail\n'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be\nWe gotta sink the Bismark to the bottom of the sea\n\nWe'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss\nWe gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us\nHit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around\nWhen we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down\n\nThe fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun\nTen hours away from homeland the Bismark made its run\nThe Admiral of the British fleet said turn those bows around\nWe found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down\n\nThe British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast\nThe first shell hit the Bismark: they knew she couldn't last\nThat mighty German battleship is just a memory\nSink the Bismark was the battle cry that shook the seven seas\n\nWe found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss\nWe had to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us\nWe hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around\nWe found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down\n\nWe found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss\nWe had to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us\nWe hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around\nWe found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down",
