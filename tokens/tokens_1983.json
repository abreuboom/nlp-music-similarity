Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear: can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run: you better take cover\"\n\n\"Living in a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear: can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run: you better take cover\"\n\n\"Living in a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear: can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run: you better take cover\"\n\n\"Living in a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear: can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run: you better take cover\"",

(It's two A.M.)\nThe fear has gone (The fear has gone)\nI'm sittin' here waitin' (I'm sittin' here waitin')\nThe gun still warm (The gun still warm)\nMaybe my connection is tired of takin' chances\n\nYeah there's a storm on the loose: sirens in my head\nI'm wrapped up in silence: all circuits are dead\nI cannot decode\nMy whole life spins into a frenzy\n\nHelp I'm steppin' into the twilight zone\nThe place is a madhouse: feels like being cloned\nMy beacon's been moved under moon and star\nWhere am I to go: now that I've gone too far? (oh)\n\nHelp I'm steppin' into the twilight zone\nThe place is a madhouse: feels like being cloned\nMy beacon's been moved under moon and star\nWhere am I to go: now that I've gone too far?\n\nYou will come to know\nWhen the bullet hits the bone\nSoon you will come to know\nWhen the bullet hits the bone\n\nI'm falling down a spiral: destination unknown\nA double-crossed messenger all alone\nI can't get no connection\nCan't get through: where are you?\n\nWell the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind\nThis far from the borderline\nAnd when the hit man comes\nHe knows damn well he has been cheated\nAnd he says\n\nHelp I'm steppin' into the twilight zone\nThe place is a madhouse: feels like being cloned\nMy beacon's been moved under moon and star\nWhere am I to go: now that I've gone too far? (oh)\n\nHelp I'm steppin' into the twilight zone\nThe place is a madhouse: feels like being cloned\nMy beacon's been moved under moon and star\nWhere am I to go: now that I've gone too far?\n\nSoon you will come to know\nWhen the bullet hits the bone\nSoon you will come to know\nWhen the bullet hits the bone\nWhen the bullet hits the bone\n\nHelp I'm steppin' into the twilight zone\nThe place is a madhouse: feels like being cloned\nMy beacon's been moved under moon and star\nWhere am I to go: now that I've gone too far?

I want you can't you tell\n\nOne on one I wanna play that game tonight\nOne on one I know I wanna play that\nOne on one I wanna play that game tonight\nOne on one so slow\nThat's all you need to know now\n\n'Cause if it's really right there's nothing else\nOne on one I want to play that game tonight...\nOne on one\nI wanna play that game tonight\n\nOne on one\nI wanna play that game tonight\n(One on one)\n\nOne on one\nI wanna play that game tonight\n(One on one I wanna play that game tonight)\n\nOne on one I wanna play that game\n(One) on one (on one) on one: girl\n(On one) ooooooh: there's nothing else\n(On one) but you and me (on one)\nI want no one else (on one)\nI don't want no one else (on one)\nOh: baby: I'm tired of playing (on one)\nI'm tired of playing (on one)\nI don't want to play those games no more...",

        "Lyrics": "Well: we're living here in Allentown \nAnd they're closing all the factories down \nOut in Bethlehem they're killing time \nFilling out forms \nStanding in line \n\nWell: our fathers fought the second World War \nSpent their weekends on the Jersey shore \nMet our mothers in the USO \nAsked them to dance \nDanced with them slow \n\nAnd we're living here in Allentown \nBut the restlessness was handed down \nAnd it's getting very hard to stay \n\nWell we're waiting here in Allentown \nFor the Pennsylvania we never found \nFor the promises our teachers gave \nIf we worked hard \nIf we behaved \n\nSo the graduations hang on the wall \nBut they never really helped us at all \nNo they never taught us what was real \nIron and coke \nChromium Steel \n\nAnd we're waiting here in Allentown \nBut they've taken all the coal from the ground \nAnd the union people crawled away \n\nEvery child had a pretty good shot \nTo get at least as far as their old man got \nBut something happened on the way to that place \nThey threw an American flag in our face \n\nWell: I'm living here in Allentown \nAnd it's hard to keep a good man down \nBut I won't be getting up today \n\nAnd it's getting very hard to stay \nAnd we're living here in Allentown",

Is the head dead yet?\nYou know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet\nGet the widow on the set\nWe need dirty laundry\n\nYou don't really need to find out what's going on\nYou don't really want to know just how far it's gone\nJust leave well enough alone\nKeep your dirty laundry\n\nKick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're stiff: kick 'em all around\n\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're stiff: kick 'em all around)\n\nDirty little secrets: dirty little lies\nWe got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie\nLove to cut you down to size\nWe love dirty laundry\n\nWe can do the innuendo: we can dance and sing\nWhen it's said and done: we haven't told you a thing\nWe all know that crap is king\nGive us dirty laundry\n\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up: kick 'em when they're down)",

Why would I lie?\n\nYou can say anything you like\nBut you can't touch the merchandise\nShe'll give you every penny's worth\nBut it will cost you a dollar first\n\nYou can step outside your little world\n(Step outside your world)\nYou can talk to a pretty girl\nShe's everything you dream about\n\n(But don't fall in love) She's a beauty\n(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls\n(Why would I lie?) Why would I lie?\n(But don't fall in love) If you do: you'll find out she don't love you\n(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls\n(Why would I lie?) Now why would I lie? Uh\n\n(Step outside your world)\n\n(But don't fall in love) She's a beauty\n(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls\n(Why would I lie?) Now why would I lie?\n(But don't fall in love) If you do: you'll find out she don't love you\n(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls\n(Why would I lie?)

Are you gonna be out there all night?\n\nThe day they knocked down the palais\nMy sister stood and cried\nBut then they knocked down the palais\nPart of my childhood died: just like...\n\nNow I'm grown up and playing in a band\nAnd there's a car park where the palais used to stand\nMy sister's married: and she lives on an estate\nHer daughters go out: now it's her turn to wait\nShe knows they get away with things she never could\nAnd like if I asked her: I wonder if she would\n\nCome dancing\nCome on: sister: have yourself a ball\nDon't be afraid to come dancing\nIt's only natural\n\nCome dancing\nJust like the palais on a Saturday\nAnd all her friends would come dancing\nWhile the big bands used to play",

It isn't fair\nI don't have enough: now I want my share\nCan't you see: I wanna live\nBut you just take more than you give\n\nWell: there's a pretty girl serving\nAt the counter of the corner shop\nShe's been waiting back there: waiting for a dream\nHer dreams walk in and out; they never stop\nWell she's not too proud: to cry out loud\nShe runs to the street and she screams...\n\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI don't have enough: now I want my share\nCan't you see: I wanna live\nBut you just take more than you give\n\nMore than you give...\n\nTake a step back and see the little people\nThey might be young:\nBut they're the ones that make the big people big\nSo listen as they whisper:\n\"What about me?\"\n\nAnd now I'm standing on the corner:\nAll the world's gone home\nNobody's changed: nobody's been saved\nAnd I'm feeling cold and alone\nI guess I'm lucky: I smile a lot\nBut sometimes I wish for more: than I've got...\n\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI don't have enough: now I want my share\nCan't you see: I wanna live\nBut you just take more...\n\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI don't have enough: now I want my share\nCan't you see: I wanna live\nBut you just take more: you just take more\nYou just take more than you give\n\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?\nWhat about... me?",

Why?\"\nTell 'em that is human nature\n\"Why: why: does he do me that way?\"\nIf they say: \"Why? Why?\"\nTell 'em that is human nature\n\"Why: why: does he do me that way?\"\n\nReaching out to touch a stranger\nElectric eyes are everywhere\nSee that girl: she knows I'm watching\nShe likes the way I stare\n\nIf they say: \"Why? Why?\"\nTell 'em that is human nature\n\"Why: why: does he do me that way?\"\nIf they say: \"Why? Why?\"\nTell 'em that is human nature \n\"Why: why: does he do me that way?\"\nI like living this way \nI like loving this way \n\nHow why why\nHow why why\n\nLooking out across the morning\nThe city's heart begins to beat\nReaching out: I touch her shoulder\nI'm dreaming of the street\n\nIf they say: \"Why? Why?\"\nTell 'em that is human nature \n\"Why: why: does he do me that way?\"\nIf they say: \"Why? Why?\"\nTell 'em that is human nature \n\"Why: why: does he do me that way?\"\nI like living this way: yeah \n\nHow why why\nHow why why",
