        "Lyrics": "I'm comin' home: I've done my time\nNow I've got to know what is and isn't mine\nIf you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free\nThen you'll know just what to do if you still want me\nIf you still want me\n\nWhoa: tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree\nIt's been three long years: do you still want me? (still want me)\nIf I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree\nI'll stay on the bus: forget about us: put the blame on me\nIf I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree\n\nBus driver: please look for me\n'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see\nI'm really still in prison and my love: she holds the key\nA simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free\nI wrote and told her please\n\nWhoa: tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree\nIt's been three long years: do you still want me? (still want me)\nIf I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree\nI'll stay on the bus: forget about us: put the blame on me\nIf I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree\n\nNow the whole damn bus is cheerin' and I can't believe I see\nA hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole oak tree\nI'm comin' home: umm-hmm\n\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)\n(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)",

        "Lyrics": "She's faced the hardest times you could imagine\nAnd many times her eyes fought back the tears\nAnd when her youthful world was about to fall in\nEach time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears\nAnd a sorrow no one hears\nStill rings in midnight silence in her ears\n\nLet her cry: for she's a lady (She's a lady)\nLet her dream: for she's a child (Child)\nLet the rain fall down upon her\nShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild\n\nAnd if by chance I should hold her (If by chance that I should hold her)\nLet me hold her for a time (Let me hold her for a time)\nBut if allowed just one possession\nI would pick her from the garden to be mine (I would pick her from the garden to be mine)\n\nBe careful how you touch her: for she'll awaken\nAnd sleep's the only freedom that she knows\nAnd when you walk into her eyes: you won't believe\nThe way she's always paying for a debt she never owes\nAnd a silent wind still blows\nThat only she can hear and so she goes\n\nLet her cry: for she's a lady\nLet her dream: for she's a child\nLet the rain fall down upon her\nShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild\n\nLet her cry: for she's a lady (She's a lady)\nLet her dream: for she's a child\nLet the rain fall down upon her\nShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild\nShe's a flower growing wild\nShe's free",
