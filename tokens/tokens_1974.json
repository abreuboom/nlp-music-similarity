There\nseems to have been some disturbance here.  Pardon me: sir: did you see\nwhat happened?\n\nYeah: I did.  I's standin' overe there by the tomaters: and here he\ncome: running through the pole beans: through the fruits and vegetables:\nnekkid as a jay bird!  And I hollered over t' Ethel: I said: \"Don't\nlook: Ethel!\"  But it's too late: she'd already been incensed!\n\nHere he comes: \n(boogity boogity)\nThere he goes: \n(boogity boogity)\nAnd he ain't wearin' no clothes\n\nOh yes: they call him the Streak\n(boogity boogity)\nFastest thing on two feet\n(boogity boogity)\nHe's just as proud as he can be\nOf his anatomy\nHe gon' give us a peek\n\nOh: yes: they call him the Streak\n(boogity boogity)\nHe likes to show off his physique\n(boogity boogity)\nIf there's an audience to be found\nHe'll be streakin' around\nInvitin' public critique\n\nThis is your Action News reporter once again and we're here at the gas\nstation.  Pardon me: sir: did you see what happened?\n\nYeah: I did.  I's just in here gettin my tires checked: he just appeared\nout of the traffic.  Come streakin' around the grease rack there: didn't\nhave nothin' on but a smile.  I looked in there: and Ethel was gettin'\nher a cold drink.  I hollered: \"Don't look: Ethel!\"  But it was too\nlate.  She'd already been mooned.  Flashed her right there in front of\nthe shock absorbers.\n\nHe ain't rude: \n(boogity boogity)\nHe ain't lewd: \n(boogity boogity)\nHe's just in the mood to run in the nude\n\nOh: yes: they call him the Streak\n(boogity boogity)\nHe likes to turn the other cheek\n(boogity boogity)\nHe's always makin' the news\nWearin' just his tennis shoes\nGuess you could call him unique\n\nOnce again: your Action News reporter in the booth at the gym: covering\nthe disturbance at the basketball playoff.  Pardon me: sir: did you see\nwhat happened?\n\nYeah: I did.  Half time: I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow\ncone.  And here he come: right out of the cheap seats: dribbling: right\ndown the middle of the court.  Didn't have on nothing but his Keds.\nMade a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand.  I hollered up\nat Ethel: I said: \"Don't look: Ethel!\"  But it was too late.  She'd\nalready got a free shot.  Grandstandin': right there in front of the\nhome team.\n\nOh: yes: they call him the Streak\n(boogity boogity)\nThe fastest thing on two feet\n(boogity boogity)\nHe's just as proud as he can be\nOf his anatomy\nHe gon' give us a peek\n\nHere he comes again\nWho's that with him?\nEthel? Is that you: Ethel?\nWhat do you think you're doin'?\nYou git your clothes on!\n\nOh: yes: they call him the Streak\n(boogity boogity)\nHe likes to show off his physique\n(boogity boogity)\nIf there's an audience to be found\nHe'll be streakin' around\nInvitin' public critique\n\nEthel! Where you goin'?\nEthel: you shameless hussy!\nSay it isn't so: Ethel!\nEthel!",

        "Lyrics": "The fortune queen of New Orleans\nWas brushing her cat in her black limousine\nOn the back seat were scratches from\nThe marks of men her fortune she had won\n\nCouldn't see through the tinted glass\nShe said: \"Home James\" and he hit the gas\nI followed her to some darkened room\nShe took my money: she said: \"I'll be with you soon\"\n\nDark lady laughed and danced\nAnd lit the candles one by one\nDanced to her gypsy music\n'Till her brew was done\n\nDark lady played black magic\n'Till the clock struck on the twelve\nShe told me more about me\nThan I knew myself\n\nShe dealt two cards\nA queen and a three\nAnd mumbled some words\nThat were so strange to me\n\nAnd then she turned up\nA two-eyed jack\nMy eyes saw red\nBut the card still stayed black\n\nShe said: \"The man you love is secretly true\nTo someone else who is very close to you\nMy advice is that you leave this place\nNever come back and forget you ever saw my face\"\n\nDark lady laughed and danced\nAnd lit the candles one by one\nDanced to her gypsy music\n'Till her brew was done\n\nDark lady played black magic\n'Till the clock struck on the twelve\nShe told me more about me\nThan I knew myself\n\nSo I ran home and crawled in my bed\nI couldn't sleep because of all the things she said\nThen I remembered her strange perfume\nAnd how I smelled it once in my own room\n\nSo I sneaked back and caught her with my man\nLaughing and kissing 'till they saw the gun in my hand\nThe next thing I knew they were dead on the floor\nDark lady would never turn a card up anymore\n\nDark lady laughed and danced\nAnd lit the candles one by one\nDanced to her gypsy music\n'Till her brew was done\n\nDark lady played black magic\n'Till the clock struck on the twelve\nShe told me more about me\nThan I knew myself",

        "Lyrics": "I've been driving all night: my hands wet on the wheel\nThere's a voice in my head that drives my heel\nIt's my baby calling: says \"I need you here\"\nAnd it's a half past four and I'm shifting gear\n\nWhen she is lonely and the longing gets too much\nShe sends a cable coming in from above\nDon't need no phone at all\n\nWe've got a thing that's called radar love\nWe've got a wave in the air\nRadar love\n\nThe radio is playing some forgotten song\nBrenda Lee's \"Coming On Strong\"\nThe road has got me hypnotized\nAnd I'm speeding into a new sunrise\n\nWhen I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough\nShe sends her comfort coming in from above\nWe don't need no letter at all\n\nWe've got a thing that's called radar love\nWe've got a line in the sky\nRadar love\n\nNo more speed: I'm almost there\nGotta keep cool now: gotta take care\nLast car to pass: here I go\nAnd the line of cars goes down real slow\n\nAnd the radio played that forgotten song\nBrenda Lee's \"Coming On Strong\"\nAnd the newsman sang his same song\nOh: one more radar lover gone\n\nWhen I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough\nShe sends her comfort coming in from above\nWe don't need no letter at all\n\nWe've got a thing that's called radar love\nWe've got a line in the sky\nWe've got a thing that's called radar love\nWe've got a thing that's called\nRadar love",

A. to live forever.\nCalifornia life alone is just too hard to build.\nI live in a house that looks out over the ocean.\nAnd there's some stars that fell from the sky\nAnd livin' up on the hill.\nPlease come to L. A.\nShe just said: \"No.\nBoy: won't you come home to me?\"\n\nAnd she said: \"Hey: ramblin' boy:\nWhy don't you settle down?\nL. A. can't be your kind of town.\nThere ain't no gold and\nThere ain't nobody like me.\nNo: no: I'm the number one fan\nOf the man from Tennessee.\nI'm the number one fan\nOf the man from Tennessee.\"",
