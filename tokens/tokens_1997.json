        "Lyrics": "Goodbye England's rose\nMay you ever grow in our hearts\nYou were the grace that placed itself\nWhere lives were torn apart\n\nYou called out to our country\nAnd you whispered to those in pain\nNow you belong to heaven\nAnd the stars spell out your name\n\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\nLike a candle in the wind\nNever fading with the sunset\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\nAlong England's greenest hills\nYour candle's burned out long before\nYour legend never will\n\nLoveliness we've lost\nThese empty days without your smile\nThis torch: we'll always carry\nFor our nation's golden child\n\nAnd even though we try\nThe truth brings us to tears\nAll our words cannot express\nThe joy you brought us through the years\n\nAnd it seems to me you've lived your life\nLike a candle in the wind\nNever fading with the sunset\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\nAlong England's greenest hills\nYour candle's burned out long before\nYour legend never will\n\nGoodbye England's rose\nMay you ever grow in our hearts\nYou were the grace that placed yourselves\nWhere lives were torn apart\n\nGoodbye England's rose\nFrom a country lost without your soul\nWho'll miss the wings of your compassion\nMore than you will ever know\n\nAnd it seems to me you've lived your life\nLike a candle in the wind\nNever fading with the sunset\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\nAlong England's greenest hills\nYour candle's burned out long before\nYour legend ever will\n\nAnd your footsteps will always fall here\nAlong England's greenest hills\nYour candle's burned out long before\nYour legend ever will",

(Left me so confused)\nNow I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)\nNow I'm all cried out (I'm so sorry: baby)\nOver you\n\nYes: I'm sorry\nPlease forgive me: oh-oh (Whoo!)\nPlease forgive me",

Fuck y'all: with a gang of bodyguards: my niggas is stone cold killas: peelas: dippin' out the limos and bitch: y'all just maintain: givin' my babies all of my money: but my diamonds steady be shinin'. My gang: you know me. Homies got mo' love: and the Biz follow all of my senses: pump my fist to Mo Thug: gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders: Jesus sent me his roll and (?) soul but load a revolver: hold up: now: buck 'em all to Hell: 'cause I'm showin' 'em. And I seen that the bulletholes was too much: no luck: ya get blowed up: all of you niggas goes out. The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up. Hold up: and wait a minute. It's time for Bone Thugs: 'cause y'all think that you can really hate: nigga.\n\nKrayzie:\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?\n\nKrayzie:\nWhat makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original? What's worse: tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago. And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit. I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya: and don't crash: collide: lock up with the enemy. And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that: but a y'all fin to get stomped. Let 'em loose. And they heard the news: ya run up: ya could get dead: oh. Uh-huh: hey: we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way--fully automatic when we let 'em lay. \"Aw shit! Get down: Leatherface.\" Fuck 'em all: if I can't get my respect. Come on: now: put them to rest. What a bloody: bloody mess: but nevertheless: we won't stress. I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me. It's all in your mind: but in time: you'll find we as real as we speak .\n\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?\n\nLayzie:\nAll I see is this soldier: pistol in holster: givin' you the most. I toast to them thugs. Nigga: nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table. And a nigga wanna test: catch slugs: put 'em in the mud. Harmony smooth with the thug shit: mo murda to the fools that clone: five niggas loc'd out with the roughness: nigga: and it's war when you craft these Bones. We can get it on: and I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches. Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that. Rollin' with the E since ninety-three: shuttin' shit down in the industry: nigga: can you bite that? I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros: and make friend of foes: but we chosen. God done blessed us with His potion: pure devotion: freely spoken: baby. Niggas can't see us never: stay together: my click too clever: ridin' through the days of the stormy weather: remember: eternal: it means forever lastin'. #1 Assassin blastin'. Bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'. All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues: when He come\n. We won't be losin': provin' 'em wrong.\n\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?\n\nWish:\nI see five killa realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go: true to pull the trigger: smother a nigga: put 'em in a river: we the killas: and that's for sure. Niggas out there clownin' mine: you can't rhyme: the style you got is all mine: and when I see you: bitch: I'm goin' in your pockets double-time: and it's like that: you don't want that. Come and get some pap: pap. Wanna sound like-- Wanna be like-- Nigga: we can't have that. Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps. Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin': tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin'. Fuck it: let's peel caps: buck 'em all down. Put 'em in check: fuck 'em up with the 44 mag: I'm glad: 'cause when you're fuckin' with Bone: we sendin' 'em home in a bodybag. Now: look into my eyes: bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with harmony: harmony.\n\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nWould you look into my eyes?\nLook into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.\nCould you tell me what you see?",

'Cause it's crazy how I\nGet you captured with my tactics: I got many witnesses\nThat can back this ruffnecks from New York to LA\nBeen down with me since Poor George\nIt's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to\nMake the ill type moves: I guide the best and ride it well\nAnd if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I\n\nChorus (repeat)\n\nGet out my shit: Please let me be: I don't see why -- you KGB\nWhy you gotta be all up on me like that: Trying to get over\nLike a fat rat: but I understand -- I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop\nAnd the shit don't stop: it goes on: on: on: on\nYou see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn\nAnd now who makes it liver than a hip-hop: scuba diver: chillin' with\nA pina colada: kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I gotta\nLot of gear from everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)\nBut I'd rather do Kani: Don't ask why! 5001: my son gets shit done\nAll on the catwalk: What they've ever done for you\nYou betta get down with your real crew: 'Cause I ride the beat\nAnd I ride it well and if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I\n\nChorus (repeat)\n\nTo the L: to the Y: and the T: to the E\nRock the house and rock the house",

        "Lyrics": "Now I've seen places and faces\nAnd things you ain't never thought about thinking\nIf you ain't peeped then you must be drinking\nAnd smokin'\nPretending that your loc'n but you're broken\nLet me get you open\nNow little Timmy got his diploma and\nLittle Jimmy got life\nAnd Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe\nThe other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money\nAnd when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny\nBut who's the dummy?\n'Cause now you done lost a hustler\nA down-ass brother done been replaced by a bustler\nAnd though I got love for you\nI know I can't trust you\n'Cause my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters\nAnd just because of that you act you don't like the brother no more\nI guess that's just the way it goes\nI ain't tryin' ta preach\nI believe I can reach\nBut your mind ain't prepared\nI'll see you when you get there\n\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\n\nMore temptation than faith\nI guess we livin' for the day\nI seen a man get swept off his feet\nBy a boy with an AK\nThe situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted\nI'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business\n'Cause it's way too serious so you gotta pay close attention\nSo you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'\nLife is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart\nSome of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we got a later start\nBut I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender\nAnd if everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner\nNo matter your rag colour deep down we all brothers\nAnd regardless of the times somebody up there still love us\nI'm a scuffle and struggle till I'm breathless and weak\nI done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak\nAlways keep reachin' sure to grab on to something\nI'll be there when you get there waitin' wit the sound pumpin'\n\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\nAh ah etc\n\nYou need to loosen up\nAnd live a little\nAnd if you got kids let them know how you feel\nAnd for your own sake give a little\nOh: you don't want to hear that\nToo busy tryin' a stack\nAnd keep up with the Jones's taking advantage of your own\nThe realist homies that you been knowin' for the longest\nBut some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone\nCould have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us\nWe prefer to keep our eyes shut to what's right\nWhen it's something involved that we desire\nSo hold your head up high if your poor and righteous\nYes I know time seems strife\nAnd problems seem endless\nBut in times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together\nAnd if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it\n'Cause nothing worse than a quitter\nYou gotta face responsibility one day: my brother\nSo gather up your pity and turn it to ambition\nAnd put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side\n\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\n\nAs we walk down the road of our destiny\nAnd the time comes to choose which shall it be\nThe wide and crooked or the straight and narrow\nWe got one push to give and one life to live\nSo stand up for something or lay down in your game\nListen to the song that we sing\nIt's up to you to make your peace\nI guess I'll see you when you see me\n\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there",

I spend quality time\nCute face haircut like the Hally design\nKeep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup\nBut you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up\nShop till you drop cause the cream don't stop\nBuy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot\nSo she could look good for Hev D\nOverweight loving MC rub you gently\nYou know its C big CEO sex-o-pee\nMac game similar next to gold and flex\nYou might feelme creeping to your room late at night\nIt's hell a waterbed so get it right\nYou be like that it's that big nigger we all up tonight\nGame ear tight why you caught up in the hype\nThat's right that's miggie: miggie: biggie\nBaby your ready for big daddy\n\nCharlie\n\nYou on my mind like all the time\nYou genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign\nBoo be all that and then some\nJob all that mad smyth is a rat-a-tat-at income\nHand New Yorkers wish you represent from\n24-7 you the one that I be sweating\nYou and time that's no question couldn't be nothin' less than\nSexually the best next to me I confess\nYou got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic\nNow sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty\nNothin' could compare to you Boo I swear to you\nI feel for you for real for you\nAll I wanna do is be with you\nMight even steal for you\nYou walk like talk like sexy\nWhen you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me\nYou on my mind like all the time pussy ass nigger bitches\nYou genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign\n\nChorus: repeat until fade",

Nigga you black: smile for me now)\nSmile for me (Nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)\nWon't you smile (No doubt: smile for me now) just smile for me (And the next generation)\n\nScarface:\nNow as I open up my story: with the blaze o' your blunts\nAnd you can picture thoughts slowly: upon phrases I wrote\nAnd I can walk you through the days that I done\nI often wish that I could save everyone: but I'm a dreamer\n\nHave you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game\nOverlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came\nLook back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain\nTurnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine\n\nTo many hassles in my local life: survivin' the strain\nAnd a man without a focus: life could drive him insane\nStuck inside a ghetto fantasy: hopin' it'd change\nBut when I focus on reality: we broke and in chains\n\nHad a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big\nOver foot broad chose to cook raw: wouldn't take but I did\nAnd after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child\nAll my momma gots to do now: is collect it and smile\n\nSmile for me: won't you smile\nJust smile: smile for me\nSmile: for me\nWon't you smile: for me\n\n2Pac:\nFuck the world as we elope and witness furious speeds\nUnanswered questions keep us all stressin': curious G's\nBackstabbed and bleedin': crooked thoughts laced with weed\nLearnin': duckin' stray shots: bullets be hot: they burnin'\n\nInhalin' sherm smoke: visualized the flames\nWill I be smothered by my own pain\nStrange whispers: cowards conversate: so quick to diss us\nTakin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us\n\nHit us off: give us plenty centuries: forgive my sins\nSince I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge\nIs fuck friends: we military minded soldiers\nBustin' shots blindly: tryin' to find Jehovah\n\nTo help me: somebody save me: lost and crazy\nScared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies\nMaybe now niggas feel me now: picture my pain\nEmbrace my words make the world change: and still I smile nigga\n\nScarface (Spoken):\nAnd now a moment of silence: let us pray.\nAnd as you journey into outer-space: may the angels help to lead the way.\nMay the prayers that the families made: shine up on your soul to keep you safe.\nAnd all the homies that done passed away: be there to greet you as you pass the gates.\nAnd as you headed to the tunnel's light: I hope it leads to eternal life.\nCan we say a prayer for our homie 'Pac?\n\nSmile\n\n(Smile for me)\n(All ya need to do is smile)\n(Woo smile for me)\n(Come on smile for me)",

        "Lyrics": "Mase: and Brian McKnight: Bad Boy\nC'mon\nBad Boy We don't stop: we rock we rock\nYo\nI hit you with the sound that the world can't take\nCame straight out the gate playing 2.8\nReal studded jewel funded\nGot to love it\nFirst rap cat with the R&B budget\nEvery day on the TV me and PD\nGirl's so pretty: make their man break the CD\nWhy y'all forever roudy\nI be out here somewhere in Maui\nTill I go back to Cali\n\nCan't understand how he can treat you the way that he does\nGive me the chance to show you baby: your better off with me\n(Ooh: so will you let me try\nI wanna make you smile)\nI wanna love you like you need to be loved\n(I won't ever let you down\nI'll always be around)\nAnd you should be mine\n(He don't love you right\nDon't waste your time\nDon't waste your time)\n\nIf he don't treat you like he should (no baby)\nThan you should be mine\nYou should be mine: baby\n\nWhy can't you see\nYou should be happy\nAnd I don't know why you don't believe a man can love you for the rest of your life\n(So baby let me try\nI wanna make you smile)\nI wanna love you like you need to be loved\n(I'll never let you down\nI'll always be around)\nAnd you should be mine\nIf he don't love you right (Ooh)\nDon't waste your time\nDon't waste your time\nIf he don't treat you like he should (now)\nThen you should be mine\nYou should be mine (Ooh ooh)\n\nYo!\nWhat the deal honey\nInsecure feel funny\nI know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money\nPlus I know you're like Mase in alot of ways\nBut it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays\nWhen you shopping did you shop for 2\nUh!\nTake you where the waters aqua blue\nLet you fall back\nTreat you like you're all that\nUnder umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat\nYou ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night\nJust to save a fight\nOr say he's right\nAnd I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life\nEven though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife\nHow a man deserve you if he hurt you\nThen he give a woman 25 a curfew\nBetween me and you: you ain't heard that from me\n'Cause Mase ain't the player with the PhD\n\nGirl come into my world\nI love you the way that you need to be loved\nNo worries: no more\nGirl open the door\nAnd don't waste your time\n'Cause you should be mine\nIf he don't love you right (ooh baby)\nDon't waste your time (don't waste your time)\nIf he don't treat you like he should (ooh)\nYou should be mine (should be mine: baby baby)\nIf he don't love you right\nDon't waste your time (don't waste your time)",
