        "Lyrics": "I hear your name whispered on the wind\nIt's a sound that makes me cry\nI hear a song blow again and again\nThrough my mind and I don't know why\n\nI wish I didn't feel so strong about you\nLike happiness and love revolve around you\nTrying to catch your heart\nIs like trying to catch a star\n\nSo many people love you baby\nThat must be what you are\n\nWaiting for a star to fall\nAnd carry your heart into my arms\nThat's where you belong\nIn my arms baby: yeah\n\nWaiting for a star to fall\nAnd carry your heart into my arms\nThat's where you belong\nIn my arms baby: yeah\n\nI've learn to feel what I cannot see\nBut with you: I lose that vision\nI don't know how to dream your dream\nSo I'm all caught up in the superstition\n\nI want to reach out and pull you to me\nWho says I should let a wild one go free\nTrying to catch your heart\nIs like trying to catch a star\n\nBut I can't love you this much baby\nAnd love you from this far\n\nWaiting for a star to fall\nAnd carry your heart into my arms\nThat's where you belong\nIn my arms baby: yeah\n\nWaiting for a star to fall\nAnd carry your heart into my arms\nThat's where you belong\nIn my arms baby: yeah\n\nWaiting (however long)\nI don't like waiting\n(I'll wait for you)\nIt's so hard waiting\n(Don't be too long)\nSeems like waiting\nMakes me love you even more\n\nWaiting for a star to fall\nAnd carry your heart into my arms\nThat's where you belong\nIn my arms baby: yeah",

(gotta blame it on something)\nGotta blame it on something...\n\n(Blame it on the rain) that was fallin' fallin'...\n(Blame it on the stars) that did shine at night...\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you...\nBlame it on the rain... (yeah yeah)\nYou can blame it on the rain...\n\nShould've told her you were sorry... (sorry)\nCould have said you were wrong...\nBut no you couldn't do that...\nYou had to prove you were strong...\nOoh if you hadn't been so blinded... (blinded)\n\nShe might still be there with you...\nYou want her back again...\nBut she just don't feel the same...\nGotta blame it on something... (gotta blame it on something)\nGotta blame it on something...\n\n(Blame it on the rain) that was fallin' fallin'...\n(Blame it on the stars) that did shine at night...\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you...\nBlame it on the rain... (yeah yeah)\n\nGo on and blame it on the rain...\n'Cause the rain don't mind\nAnd the rain don't care\nYou got to blame it on something\n\n(Blame it on the rain) that was fallin' fallin'...\n(Blame it on the stars) that did shine at night...\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you...\nBlame it on the rain... (yeah yeah)\nYou can blame it on the rain\n\n(Blame it on the rain yeah: yeah)\n(Blame it on the rain yeah: yeah)\n(Blame it on the rain yeah: yeah)\n\nYou can blame it on the rain:\nBlame it on the rain:\nBlame it on the rain baby\n(Blame it on the rain yeah yeah)\n\nBlame it on the stars that did shine that night\n(Blame it on the rain yeah yeah)\nBlame it: blame it on the rain\nWoo\n\nI'm walking\nI'm walking\nWalking in the rain\nWalking in the rain\n\n(Rain: rain)\n(Stars: stars)\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you\n(Blame it on the rain)\nYeah yeah\n\n(Blame it on the rain)\nThat keeps falling: falling\n(Blame it on the stars)\nThat did shine that night\nWhatever you do don't put the blame on you\nBlame it on the rain yeah yeah\nBlame it on the rain (rain: rain)",

        "Lyrics": "Every generation\nBlames the one before\nAnd all of their frustrations\nCome beating on your door\n\nI know that I'm a prisoner\nTo all my father held so dear\nI know that I'm a hostage\nTo all his hopes and fears\nI just wish I could have told him\nIn the living years\n\nOh: crumpled bits of paper\nFilled with imperfect thought\nStilted conversations\nI'm afraid that's all we've got\n\nYou say you just don't see it\nHe says it's perfect sense\nYou just can't get agreement\nIn this present tense\nWe all talk a different language\nTalking in defense\n\n(Say it loud) Say it loud\n(Say it clear) Say it clear\n(You can listen) As well as you hear\n\n(It's too late) It's too late\n(When we die) Oh: when we die\n(To admit) We don't see eye to eye\n\nSo we open up a quarrel\nBetween the present and the past\nWe only sacrifice the future\nIt's the bitterness that lasts\n\nSo don't yield to the fortunes\nYou sometimes see as fate\nIt may have a new perspective\nOn a different date\nAnd if you don't give up and don't give in\nYou may just be okay\n\n(Say it loud) Say it loud\n(Say it clear) Say it clear\n(You can listen) As well as you hear\n\n(It's too late) It's too late\n(When we die) Oh: when we die\n(To admit) We don't see eye to eye\n\nI wasn't there that morning\nWhen my father passed away\nI didn't get to tell him\nAll the things I had to say\n\nI think I caught his spirit\nLater that same year\nI'm sure I heard his echo\nIn my baby's new born tears\nI just wish I could have told him\nIn the living years\n\n(Say it loud) So say it: say it: say it loud\n(Say it clear) Oh: say it clear\n(You can listen) As well as you hear\n\n(It's too late) It's too late\n(When we die) It's too late when we die\n(To admit) We don't see eye to eye\n\n(Say it loud) So say it: say it: say it loud\n(Say it clear) Oh: say it clear\n(Say it loud) Don't give up: don't give in\n(Say it clear) Don't wait til it's too late",

Am I only dreaming?\nOr is this burning (burning) an eternal flame?\n\nSay my name\nSun shines through the rain\nA whole life so lonely\nAnd then you come and ease the pain\nI don't wanna lose this feeling: oh\n\nSay my name\nSun shines through the rain\nA whole life so lonely\nAnd then you come and ease the pain\nI don't wanna lose this feeling: oh\n\nClose your eyes: give me your hand\nDo you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?\nDo you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?\nOr is this burning an eternal flame?\n\nClose your eyes: give me your hand: darling\nDo you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?\nDo you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?\n(Ahh) Is this burning an eternal flame?\n\nClose your eyes: give me your hand: darling\nDo you feel my heart beating? Do you understand?\nDo you feel the same? Am I only dreaming?\nAh: an eternal flame\n\nClose your eyes: give me your hand: darling\nDo you feel my heart beating?

Not cokin'. Get funky sax.\nLooking good: hanging with the wild bunch.\nLooking good in a Buffalo Stance.\nLooking good when it comes to the crunch\nLooking good's a state of mind\nState of mind don't look behind you\nState of mind or you'll be dead\nState of mind may I remind you\nBomb the Bass... rock this place!\nWhat is he like?\nWhat's he like anyway?\nYo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man\nYou know I mean?\n\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of.\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me\n\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of.\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me\n\nWind on my face: sound in my ears\nWater from my eyes: and you on my mind\nAs I sink: diving down deep... deeper into your soul.\n\nNo moneyman can win my love\nIt's sweetness that I'm thinking of.\nWe always hang in a Buffalo Stance\nWe do the dive every time we dance\nI'll give you love baby not romance\nI'll make a move nothing left to chance\nSo don't you get fresh with me",

        "Lyrics": "Bust it\n\nThis here's a jam for all the fellas\nTry to do what those ladies tell us\nGet shot down 'cause you're overzealous\nPlay hard to get females get jealous\n\nOK smarty go to a party\nGirls are scantily clad and showin' body\nA chick walks by you wish you could sex her\nBut you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter\n\nNext day's function high class luncheon\nFood is served and you're stone cold munchin'\nMusic comes on people start to dance\nBut then you ate so much nearly split your pants\n\nA girl starts walkin' guys start gawkin'\nSits down next to you and starts talkin'\nSays she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove\nSo come on: fatso: and just bust a move\n\nJust bust a move\n\nYou're on a mission and you're wishin'\nSomeone could cure your lonely condition\nLookin' for love in all the wrong places\nNo fine girls just ugly faces\n\nFrom frustration first inclination\nIs to become a monk and leave the situation\nBut every dark tunnel has a light a hope\nSo don't hang yourself wit a celibate rope\n\nNew movie's showin' so you're goin'\nCould care less about the five you're blowin'\nTheater gets dark just to start the show\nThen you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row\n\nShe's dressed in yellow she says \"Hello:\ncome sit next to me you fine fellow\"\nYou run over there without a second to lose\nAnd what comes next? Hey: bust a move\n\n(If you want it: you got it)\n(If you want it: baby: you got it) Just bust a move\n(If you want it: you got it)\n(If you want it: baby: you got it)\n\nIn the city ladies look pretty\nGuys tell jokes so they can seem witty\nTell a funny joke just to get some play\nThen you try to make a move and she says: \"No way\"\n\nGirls are fakin' goodness sakin'\nThey want a man who brings home the bacon\nGot no money and you got no car\nThen you got no woman and there you are\n\nSome girls are sadistic materialistic\nLooking for a man makes them opportunistic\nThey're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan\nSo that a brother with money can be their man\n\nSo on the beach you're strollin' real high-rollin'\nEverything you have is yours and not stolen\nA girl runs up with somethin' to prove\nSo don't just stand there bust a move\n\n(If you want it: you got it)\n(If you want it: baby: you got it) Just bust a move\n(If you want it: you got it)\n(If you want it: baby: you got it) Break it down for me fellas\n\nYour best friend Harry has a brother Larry\nIn five days from now he's gonna marry\nHe's hopin' you can make it there if you can\n'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man\n\nYou say neato check your libido\nAnd roll to the church in your new tuxedo\nThe bride walks down just to start the wedding\nAnd there's one more girl you won't be getting\n\nSo you start thinkin' then you start blinkin'\nA bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'\nShe thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back\nAnd now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked\n\nReception's jumpin' bass is pumpin'\nLook at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'\nSays she wanna dance to a different groove\nNow you know what to do: G: bust a move\n\n(If you want it: you got it)\n(If you want it: baby: you got it) Just bust a move\n(If you want it: you got it)\n(If you want it: baby: you got it) Move it: boy",

You! Can't get away I won't let you\nWho? You! I could never forget to\nCherish is the word I use to remind me of your love\n\n(You're giving it: you're giving it to me: boy\nKeep giving me all: all: all of your joy\nGive me faith\nI will always cherish you)\n\nRomeo and Juliet: they never felt this way I bet\nSo don't underestimate my point of view\n\nWho? You! Can't get away I won't let you\nWho? You! I could never forget to\nCherish is the word I use to remind me of your love\n\nCherish\nGive me faith\nGive me joy: my boy\nI will always cherish you\nGive me faith\nGive me joy: my boy\nI will always cherish you\n\nCherish your strength\n(You're giving it: you're giving it to me: boy)\n(Can't get away: I won't let you)\n(Keep giving me all your joy)\nPerish the thought\n(You're giving it: you're giving it to me: boy)\n(I could never forget to)\n(Keep giving me all your joy)\n\nCherish the thought\n(Give me faith: give me joy: my boy)\n(I will always cherish you)\n(Can't get away: can't get away)\nCherish the joy\n(Give me faith: give me joy: my boy)\n(I will always cherish you)\n(Can't get away: can't get away)\n\nCherish your strength\n(You're giving it: you're giving it to me: boy)\n(Keep giving me all your joy)\n(Can't get away: can't get away)\nPerish the thought\n(You're giving it: you're giving it to me: boy)\n(Keep giving me all your joy)\n(Can't get away: can't get away)\n\nCherish the thought\n(Give me faith: give me joy: my boy)\n(I will always cherish you)\n(Can't get away: can't get away)\nCherish the joy\n(Give me faith: give me joy: my boy)\n(I will always cherish you)",

I can't shut my mouth\nBut when you understand me:\nYou might feel good around me\n(Now back it up)\n\nI don't want your love to bring me down\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\nI don't want your love so turn it around\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n\nYour rhythm is the power to move me\nIt's something you control completely\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love\n(I don't want your love)\n\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\nI don't want your love to bring me down\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\nI don't want your love so turn it around\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n\nI don't want your love\n(Rhythm)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n(Rhythm)\nI don't want your love\n(Rhythm)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n(The rhythm is the power)\n\nI don't want your love\n(Rhythm)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n(Rhythm)\nI don't want your love\n(Rhythm)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n(The rhythm is the power)\n\nI don't want your love\n(Rhythm)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\nTo bring me down\n(Rhythm)\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)\n(The rhythm is the power)\n\nI don't want your love\n(I don't want your love: I don't want your love)",

I got every dog in my neighborhood\nBreakin' down my door: I got Spuds McKenzie: Alex from Stroh's\nThey won't leave my dog alone with that Medina: pal\n\nI went up to this girl: she said: \"Hi: my name is Sheena\"\nI thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky cold Medina\nShe said: \"I'd like a drink: \" I said OK: I'd go get it\nThen a couple of sips: she sold licked her lips\nAnd I knew that she was with it\nSo I took her to my crib: and everything went well as planned\nBut when she got undressed: it was a big old mess\nSheena was a man\nSo I threw him out: I don't fool around\nWith in Oscar Meyer weiner\nYou must be sure that your girl is pure\nFor the Funky Cold Medina\nYou know: ain't no playin' with a man\nThis is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies: ya know?\n\nBreak it down\n\nBack in the saddle: lookin' for a little affection\nI took a shot as a contestant on the Love Connection\nThe audience voted and you know they picked a winner\nI took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner\nShe had a few drinks: I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'\nInstead she started talkin' about plans for a weddin'\nSaid wait: slow down: love: not so fast: says \"I'll be seein' ya\"\nThat's why I found you don't play around\nWith the Funky Cold Medina\nYa know what I'm sayin': that Medina's a monster: y'all\nFunky Cold Medina",

Oh no\n\nClose your eyes\nClose your eyes\nYou gotta close your eyes for me",
