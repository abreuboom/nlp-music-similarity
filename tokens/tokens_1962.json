You know: and they'd been carrying on for some time now behind the Sultan's back and you could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the dunes: his voice would cut through the still night desert air and he'd say (imitate Arabian speech) which is Arabic for: \"stop: Clyde!\" and Clyde would say: (imitate camel voice). Which is camel for: \"What the heck did he say anyway?\"\nWell...\n\nHe brought that camel to a screeching halt\nAt the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde:\nSnuck around the corner and into the tent he went\nThere he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug\nWearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes\nAnd a bone in her nose ho: ho.\n\nThere she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin: grape: apricot: pomegranate: bowl of chitterlings: two bananas: three Hershey bars: sipping on a \"R C\" Co-Cola listening to her transistor: watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung: \"Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?\" and Ahab walked up to her and he said: (imitate Arabian speech) which is Arabic for: \"Let's twist again like we did last summer: baby.\" You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug: give him one of the sly looks: she said: \"Crazy baby\".\n'Round and around and around and around... etc.\n\nAnd that's the story 'bout Ahab the Arab\nThe Sheik of the Burnin' sand\nAhab the Arab\nThe swinging Sheik of the burnin' sand",
