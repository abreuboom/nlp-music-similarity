        "Lyrics": "What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?\n\"Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?\"\nMaybe I should buy some old tab collars?\n\"Welcome back to the age of jive\n\nWhere have you been hidin' out lately: honey?\nYou can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money\"\nEverybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound\nFunny: but it's still rock and roll to me\n\nWhat's the matter with the car I'm driving?\n\"Can't you tell that it's out of style?\"\nShould I get a set of white wall tires?\n\"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?\n\nNowadays you can't be too sentimental\nYour best bet's a true baby blue Continental\"\nHot funk: cool punk: even if it's old junk\nIt's still rock and roll to me\n\nOh: it doesn't matter what they say in the papers\n'Cause it's always been the same old scene\nThere's a new band in town\nBut you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine\nAimed at your average teen\n\nHow about a pair of pink sidewinders\nAnd a bright orange pair of pants?\n\"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby\nIf you just give it half a chance\n\nDon't waste your money on a new set of speakers\nYou get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers\"\nNext phase: new wave: dance craze: anyways\nIt's still rock and roll to me\n\n(Alright: Rico)\nWooh: wooh\n\nOoh: what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?\n\"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\"\nShould I try to be a straight A student?\n\"If you are then you think too much\n\nDon't you know about the new fashion honey?\nAll you need are looks and a whole lotta money\"\nIt's the next phase: new wave: dance craze: anyways\nIt's still rock and roll to me\n\nEverybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound\nFunny: but it's still rock and roll to me",

Ol' yellow's leavin'\"\nBut you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door\n\nTwenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him\nHe wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all\nWhen Tommy left the barroom: not a Gatlin boy was standin'\nHe said: \"This one's for Becky:\" as he watched the last one fall\nAnd I heard him say\n\n\"I promised you: dad: not to do the things you done\nI walk away from trouble when I can\nNow please dont think I'm weak: I didn't turn the other cheek\nAnd papa: I sure hope you understand\nSometimes you gotta fight when youre a man\"\n\nEveryone considered him the coward of the county",

Ah...\nWe may be big or small or black or white: eternally\nAnd black and white is you and me in a special light\nWe may be young or old or in between: but this much I know\nTogether we can learn to grow\nIn a world that's ever turning it's back on you\nIf you give it all away:\nMake it mine: ine: ine: ine: mine\nYou are desire: everything you need\nI give you right or wrong\nAnd you are the woman that I\nBase my whole existence on\nAnd when I get to you my\nDesire is glowing in your light\n\nThese are the golden years we get to live\nWe lead the way: tomorrow we can start today\nIn a special light\nLove could be good or bad or in between\nBut this much I learn\nBaby: you and I can learn\nIn a world that's rearranging it's reality\nIf you give it all away\nMake it mine: ine: ine: ine: mine\nYou are desire: everything you need\nI give you right or wrong\nAnd you are the woman that I\nBase my whole existence on\nAnd when I get to you my\nDesire is glowing in your light\nAh...\nAnd it's nice to light a fire\nWhen it's cold outside\nIf you give it all away\nMake it mine: ine: ine: ine: mine\nYou are desire: everything you need\nI give you right or wrong\nAnd you are the woman that I\nBase my whole existence on\nAnd when I get to you my\nDesire is glowing in your light",
