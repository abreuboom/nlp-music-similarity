Lee\nNow I don't mind chopping wood\nAnd I don't care if the money's no good\nJust take what you need and leave the rest\nBut they should never have taken the very best\n\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the bells were ringin'\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the people were singin'\nThey went: na na na na na: na na na na\n\nLike my father before me: I'm a working man\nAnd like my brother before me: I took a rebel stand\nOh: he was just 18: proud and brave\nBut a yankee laid him in his grave\nI swear by the blood below my feet\nYou can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat\n\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the bells were ringin'\nThe night they drove old Dixie down\nAnd all the people were singin'\nThey went: na na na na na: na na na na",

What have you sacrificed?\nJesus Christ: Jesus Christ\nWho are you? What have you sacrificed?\nJesus Christ: Superstar\nDo you think you're what they say you are?\nJesus Christ: Superstar\nDo you think you're what they say you are?\n\nTell me what you think\nAbout your friends at the top\nNow who d'you think besides yourself\nWas the pick of the crop?\nBuddha was he where it's at?\nIs he where you are?\nCould Muhammad move a mountain\nOr was that just PR?\nDid you mean to die like that?\nWas that a mistake or\nDid you know your messy death\nWould be a record breaker?\n\n(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong\n(Don't you get me wrong: now) Don't you get me wrong\n(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong\n(Don't you get me wrong: now) Don't you get me wrong\n\n(Only want to know) Only want to know\n(Only want to know: now) Only want to know\n(Only want to know) Only want to know\n(Only want to know: now) I only want to know\n\nJesus Christ: Jesus Christ\nWho are you?

        "Lyrics": "I beg your pardon: I never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime\nWhen you take: you gotta give: so live and let live and let go: oh: oh: oh: oh\nI beg your pardon: I never promised you a rose garden\n\nI could promise you things like big diamond rings\nBut you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover\nSo you better think it over\nWell: if sweet talking you could make it come true\nI would give you the world right now on a silver platter\nBut what would it matter?\nSo smile for a while and let's be jolly; love shouldn't be so melancholy\nCome along and share the good times while we can\n\nI beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime\nI beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden\n\nI could sing you a tune and promise you the moon\nBut if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go\nBut there's one thing I want you to know\nYou'd better look before you leap; still waters run deep\nAnd there won't always be someone there to pull you out\nAnd you know what I'm talking about\nSo smile for a while and let's be jolly; love shouldn't be so melancholy\nCome along and share the good times while we can\n\nI beg your pardon: I never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine: there's gotta be a little rain sometime\n\nI beg your pardon: I never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine: there's gotta be a little rain sometime",
