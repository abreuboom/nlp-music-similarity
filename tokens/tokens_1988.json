        "Lyrics": "I'm gonna make a change\nFor once in my life\nIt's gonna feel real good\nGonna make a difference\nGonna make it right...\n\nAs I: turn up the collar on my\nFavorite winter coat\nThis wind is blowing my mind\nI see the kids in the street\nWith not enough to eat\nWho am I: to be blind?\nPretending not to see their needs\n\nA summer's disregard\nA broken bottle top\nAnd a one man's soul\nThey follow each other on the wind: ya' know\n'Cause they got nowhere to go\nThat's why I want you to know\n\nI'm starting with the man in the mirror\nI'm asking him to change his ways\nAnd no message could have been any clearer\nIf you wanna make the world a better place\nTake a look at yourself and then make a change\n(Na na na: na na na: na na: na nah)\n\nI've been a victim of a selfish kind of love\nIt's time that I realize\nThere are some with no home\nNot a nickel to loan\nCould it be really me\nPretending that they're not alone\n\nA widow deeply scarred\nSomebody's broken heart\nAnd a washed - out dream\n(Washed - out dream)\nThey follow the pattern of the wind: ya' see\n'Cause they got no place to be\nThat's why I'm starting with me\n\nI'm starting with the man in the mirror (Ooh!)\nI'm asking him to change his ways (Ooh!)\nAnd no message could have been any clearer\nIf you wanna make the world a better place\nTake a look at yourself and then make a change\n\nI'm starting with the man in the mirror (Ooh!)\nI'm asking him to change his ways\n(Change his ways - ooh!)\nAnd no message could have been any clearer\nIf you wanna make the world a better place\nTake a look at yourself and then make that...\nChange!\n\nI'm starting with the man in the mirror\n(Man in the mirror - oh yeah!)\nI'm asking him to change his ways\n(Better change)\nNo message could have been any clearer\nIf you wanna make the world a better place\nTake a look at yourself and then make the change\n(You gotta get it right: while\nYou got the time)\n('Cause when you close your heart)\nYou can't close your... your mind!\n(Then you close your... mind!)\n\nThat man\n(With the man in the mirror: oh yeah)\nI'm asking him to change his ways\n(Better change!)\nNo message could have been any clearer\nIf you wanna make the world a better place\nTake a look at yourself and then make a change\n\nHoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!\nNa na na: na na na: na na na nah\n(Oh yeah!)\nGonna feel real good now!\nYeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\nNa na na: na na na: na na na nah\n\n(Ooooh...)\nOh no: no: no...\nI'm gonna make a change\nIt's gonna feel real good\nCome on\n(Change...)\n\nJust lift yourself\nYou know\nYou've got to stop it\nYourself!\n(Yeah! - make that change!)\nI've got to make that change\nToday!\nHoo!\n(Man in the mirror)\n\nYou got to\nYou got to not let yourself...\nBrother...\nHoo!\n(Yeah! - make that change!)\nYou know - I've got to get\nThat man: that man...\n(Man in the mirror)\nYou've got to\nYou've got to move!\nCome on! Come on!\nYou got to\nStand up! Stand up! Stand up!\n(Yeah! - make that change!)\nStand up and lift yourself: now!\n(Man in the mirror)\nHoo! Hoo! Hoo!\nAaow!\n(Yeah: make that change)\nGonna make that change...\nCome on!\n(Man in the mirror)\nYou know it!\nYou know it!\nYou know it!\nYou know...\n(Change...)\nMake that change",

Let our lovers play the fool\nI don't know how\nTo stop feeling this way\n\nHold on to the nights\nHold on to the memories\nIf only I could give you more\n\nWell: I think I've been true to everybody else but me\nAnd the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free\nEverytime I look into your eyes: I'm helplessly aware\nThat the someone I've been searching for is right there\n\nHold on to the nights\nHold on to the memories\nI'm wishing I could give you more\n\nOh\nHold on to the nights",

        "Lyrics": "Girl... the only thing that matters in my life:\nIs that I'm down for you and treat you right\nYou've got no cause to treat me cold as ice\n\nOh: girl\nAs long as I've been giving my love to you\nYou should be giving me your love too\nBut you just keep on actin' just like a fool\nYou know it ain't cool\n\nDon't be cruel\n'Cause I would never be that cruel to you\nA no: oh a no\nDon't be cruel\nGirl you need to change your attitude\nA no: oh\nDon't be cruel\n\nHey yo cutie what's up with this attitude?\nI thought I was bein' real good to you\nI treat you sweet take you out at night\nBut you never say thanks: girl that ain't right\nI bought you diamonds even gave you pearls\nI took you for a cruise all around the world\nI treat you high post: but you play me close\nAnd if I put a drink up: you won't even toast\n\nGirl: I work so hard for you from 9 to 5\nSo you could have the finer things in life\nSince you're the kind that's never satisfied\n\nOh: girl\nAs long as I've been giving my heart to you\nYou should be giving me your heart too\nBut you just keep on actin' just like a fool\nYou know it ain't cool\n\nDon't be cruel\n'Cause I would never be that cruel to you\nA no: oh a no\nDon't be cruel\nGirl you need to change your attitude\nA no: oh\nDon't be cruel\n\nFrom fancy cars to diamond rings\nI've just about given you everything\nThere's really not much I won't do for you\nI bought you 12 yellow roses and candy too\nI like to be up front: and never play the back\nBut the way you treat me girl it's like a heart attack\nI'm a real troop-trooper aiming for the top\nAnd with you by my side big dollars I'll clock\n\nOh: girl\nAs long as I've been giving my love to you\nYou should be giving me your love too\nBut you just keep on actin' just like a fool\nYou know it ain't cool\nIt just ain't cool\n\nDon't be cruel...\nA no: oh\n\nWe used to hang out tough\nJust kickin' around\nWe discovered a love that had never been found\nYou gave me your heart: I gave you my mind\nBut a true love affair we could never find\nAlthough I want you bad: I can let you go\n'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no\nRoll to the fact that I want you Jackie\nI want you more than human eyes can see\nBut you had to start illin': tryin' to make a killin'\nThough about the dollars I make:\nAnd you were willin'\nTo be with me: Bobby B.\nBut with a bad attitude I can't compete\nNow you know my name: now I know your game\nYou wanna be with me:\nYou gotta be the same way that another girl would be\nAnd if you wanna be with me\n\nDon't be cruel\n(Don't be: don't be)\n'Cause I would never be that cruel to you\n(Don't be: don't be)...",

Uh\n\nDaylight: spent the night without you\nBut I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do\nI'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through\nHey: man: bet you can treat me right\nYou just don't know what you was missin' last night\nI wanna see you begging: say forget it just for spite\nI think of you ev'ry night and day\nYou took my heart and you took my pride away\n\nI hate myself for loving you\nCan't break free from the the things that you do\nI wanna walk but I run back to you\nThat's why I hate myself for loving you\nOw!

(wait...)\n\nBaby: I beg you to wait\nNo I never had a chance to love you",
