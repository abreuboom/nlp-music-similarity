        "Lyrics": "Ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh\nOh: ooh: oh\nSweet love: yeah\n\nI didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so\nI should've held on tight: I never should've let you go\nI didn't know nothing: I was stupid: I was foolish\nI was lying to myself\nI could not fathom that I would ever be without your love\nNever imagined I'd be sittin' here beside myself\n'Cause I didn't know you: 'cause I didn't know me\nBut I thought I knew everything: I never felt\n\nThe feeling that I'm feeling: now that I don't hear your voice\nOr have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice\nOh: what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side\nRight here 'cause: baby\n(We belong together)\n\nWhen you left: I lost a part of me\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back: baby: please\n'Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better\nOh: baby: baby: we belong together\n\nI can't sleep at night when you are on my mind\nBobby Womack's on the radio: singing to me\n\"If you think you're lonely now.\"\nWait a minute: this is too deep \nI gotta change the station \nSo I turn the dial: trying to catch a break\nAnd then I hear Babyface\nI only think of you and it's breaking my heart\nI'm trying to keep it together: but I'm falling apart\n\nI'm feeling all out of my element\nI'm throwing things: crying\nTrying to figure out where the hell I went wrong\nThe pain reflected in this song\nIt ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside\nI need you: need you back in my life: baby\n\nWhen you left: I lost a part of me\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back: baby: please\n'Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better\nOh: baby: baby: we belong together: baby\n\nWhen you left: I lost a part of me \nIt's still so hard to believe \nCome back: baby: please \n'Cause we belong together\nWho am I gonna lean on when times get rough? \nWho's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better\nOh: baby: baby: we belong together",

(I'm gonna shake it off)\n\nShake: shake: shake: shake: shake it\nOff... ooh\nShake: shake: shake: shake: shake it\nOff...\n\nI found out about a gang\nOf your dirty little deeds\nWith this one and that one\nBy the pool: on the beach: in the streets\nHeard y'all was\n\nHold up my phone's breakin' up\nImma hang up and call the machine right back\nI gotta get this off of my mind\nYou wasn't worth my time\nSo I'm leaving you behind\n\n'Cause I need a real love in my life\nSave this recording because\nI'm never coming back home\nBaby I'm gone\nDon't ya know\n\nI gotta shake it off\n'Cause the loving ain't the same\nAnd you keep on playing games\nLike you know I'm here to stay\n\nI gotta shake: shake it off\nJust like the Calgon commercial\nI really gotta get up outta here\nAnd go somewhere\n\nI gotta shake it off\n(I) Gotta make that move\nFind somebody who\nAppreciates all the love I give\n\nBoy I gotta shake: shake it off\nGotta do what's best for me\nBaby and that means I gotta\nShake it off\n\n(I gotta) shake: shake: shake: shake: shake it\nOff... ooh\nShake: shake: shake: shake: shake it\nOff... shake it off\n\nShake: shake: shake: shake: shake it\nOff... ooh\nShake: shake: shake: shake: shake it\nOff...\n\nI gotta shake it off\n'Cause the loving ain't the same\nAnd you keep on playing games\nLike you know I'm here to stay\n\nI gotta shake: shake it off\nJust like the Calgon commercial\nI really gotta get up outta here\nAnd go somewhere\n\nI gotta shake it off\nGotta make that move\nFind somebody who\nAppreciates all the love I give (I like that y'all)\nBoy I gotta shake: shake it off (uh huh)\n\nGotta do what's best for me\nBaby and that means I gotta\nShake it off\n\nEverybody just: everybody just bounce: bounce\nShake it off\nEverybody just: everybody just bounce: bounce",

On the grill of my lowrider\nGuns on both sides: right above the gold wires\nI'll fo'-five 'em: kill a nigga on my song\nAnd really do it: that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter\nTen G's'll take your daughter out of Air Forces\nBelieve you me homey: I know all about losses\nI'm from Compton: wear the wrong colors: be cautious\nOne phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy\nI stay strapped like car seats: been banging\nSince my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys\nThat's ten years: I told Pooh in ninety-five\nI'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's\nTold Banks when I met him I'mma ride\nAnd if I gotta die: I'd rather homicide\nI ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died\nNow I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on\nSee how time fly?\n\n50 Cent\nHate it or love it: the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\n(Go 'head envy me: I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere: so you can get to know me)\n\nFrom the beginning to the end: losers lose\nWinners win this is real we ain't got to pretend\nThe cold world that we in: is full of pressure and pain\nEnough of me nigga now listen to Game\n\nThe Game:\nUsed to see Five-O: throw the crack by the bench\nNow I'm fuckin' with 5-0: it's all starting to make sense\nMy moms happy: she ain't gotta pay the rent\nAnd she got a red bow on that brand new Benz\nWaiting on Sha Money to land: sitting in the Range\nThinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes\nWhen there's kids starving\nPac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage\nI wanna know \"What's Going On\" like I hear Marvin\nNo schoolbooks: they used that wood to build coffins\nWhenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted\nI think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?\nI love you ma\n\n50 Cent\nHate it or love it: the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop\n(Go 'head envy me: I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere: so you can get to know me)",

(Amen!)\nThere's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)\nA gag: a plastic bag on a monument\n\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nOn holiday!\n\n(Hey!)\n\n(Three four)\n\nThe representative from California has the floor...\n\n\"Zieg Heil\" to the president gasman\nBombs away is your punishment\nPulverize the Eiffel Towers\nWho criticize your government\n\nBang bang: goes the broken glass and\nKill all the fags that don't agree\nTrials by fire setting fire\nIs not a way that's meant for me\n\nJust 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)\nJust 'cause: because we're outlaws: yeah!\n\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\n\nThis is our lives on holiday!",

Daddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying: wipe them tears: daddy's here: no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it: we gon' do it\nLaney uncle's crazy: ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it\n\nWe're all we got in this world When it spins: when it swirls\nWhen it whirls: when it twirls two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled: in a daze: I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move: mama's always on the news\n\nI try to keep you sheltered from it: but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that: the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up his daddy: that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\n\nWe did not plan it to be this way: your mother and me\nBut things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together\nEver again like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\n\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries: rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream\n\nNow hush little baby: don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady: I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\n\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy: pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nIt's funny: I remember back one year: when daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up: and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me: 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\n\n'Cause daddy felt like a bum: see daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed\nOr shot up on the block and your mom\n\nWas saving money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad: it broke your mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\n\nMom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me\n\nBut daddy had to work: you and momma had to leave me\nThen you started seeing daddy on the TV\nAnd mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it\nPapa was a rollin' stone: momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house\nJust reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures: it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown: it's almost like you're sisters now\n\nWow: guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\nLaney I'm talkin' to you too: daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that: yeah: it's got a ring to it: don't it?\nShh: mama's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush little baby: don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up little lady: I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\n\nI know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy: pretty baby\nBut I promise mama's gon' be alright\n\nAnd if you ask me too: daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'mma give you the world\nI'mma buy a diamond ring for you: I'mma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\n\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'mma break that birdies' neck\nI'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every karat: don't fuck with dad (ha ha)",

Mobb Deep\n\n (50 Cent)\nIt's the Infamous Mobb: M-O-B-B (Ha Ha)\nWe can't be touched nigga can't you see (G-Unit!)\n\n:\nYou do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thang (You know I do my thang)\nI'm a get my drink on and party like it's ok\n\n(Verse 1: 50 Cent)\nTrust me man it's ok bounce with me in slow mo\nWhen they hear the kid in the house it's like oh no\n50 got 'em locin again: they open again\nGot 'em sippin on that juice and gin\nYou could find me in the background burnin that backwood\nStylin and stuntin doin' my two step frontin\nNow I'm a tell you What Em told me homey\nJust lose the parental discretion's advised this is grown folk music\nNow blend in with me: as I proceed to break it down\nIt's always off the chain man when I'm around\nI play the block bumpin: it was all for the dough\nI get the club jumpin': 'cause I'm sick with flow\nYou know it's sold out: like wherever I go\nI jam packed the show man that's fo' sho'\nI got the info you already know\nMan I get it poppin' in the club everybody show me love let's go\n\n(Chorus: 50 Cent)\nYou: know: I: got: what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playin' turn the music up a little bit: bounce with me now shorty let's get into it\nYou: know: I: got: what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playin' turn the music up a little bit: bounce with me now homey let's get into it\n\n(Verse 2: Havoc)\nYou wanna search me than search me but hurry up 'cause I'm thirsty\nI need that: grind in my system P: on my side twistin\nIn club today for the chick to go both: ways let me see that ID just for proof\nWith the drink till the burn is gone: hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn\nBefore it pop: make me sign a disclaimer\nTry to get me on some pop shit these chicks will frame ya\nBut: in any event: keep fuckin' with 50 it make cents\nCents: into them dollars: the hoes wanna holla\nBut you lookin' at a nigga that done came from the squalla\nNow my buddy so gone I can pop ya collar\nNow follow same nothin' let me see you swallow\nIn my crib got the co-ed back the new problem\nIn the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starvin\nSo much green gettin' twisted like Botanical Garden: let's go\n\n(Chorus: 50 Cent)\nYou: know: I: got: what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playin' turn the music up a little bit: bounce with me now shorty let's get into it\nYou: know: I: got: what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playin' turn the music up a little bit: bounce with me now homey let's get into it\n\n(Verse 3: Prodigy)\nYou already know how it go I bang I shine\nI play I stay I'm goin' for mine\nI'm young I'm black I'm rich and yes\nI'm ghetto than the motherfuckin project steps\nI'm cool I'm calm you lookin' real stressed\nI'm strapped I'm armed kid hold your head\nI'm known for Gat poppin': when I got problems\nI don't run: I just gun you all up\nBut we ain't come here to start no drama\nWe just lookin' for our future baby mamas\nWith money with face with style and body\nI cook I clean I swear that mami\nJust as long as you don't go off and tell nobody\nI go down low: I'm lyin' I'm tryin' my best to let you know\nSugar pop get at P The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets\n\n(Chorus: 50 Cent)\nYou: know: I: got: what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playin' turn the music up a little bit: bounce with me now shorty let's get into it\nYou: know: I: got: what it takes to make the club go outta control\nQuit playin' turn the music up a little bit: bounce with me now homey let's get into it",

(what you're gonna do baby?)\nWhen I really see you and what you're all about?\nNo no no no: baby: no no no no: don't lie\nBecause you know: you know: you know: you know: you know you gotta try\n\nTaboo\nYo: I'm lyin' to my girl\nEven though I love her and she all in my world\nI give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls\nShe's the one who makes me feel on top of the world\nStill I'm lyin' to my girl: I do it\n\nFergie and Taboo\nOh oh: and I lie: and I lie: and I lie (and then I lie)\nTill there's no turning back (I don't know why I lie and I lie)\nAnd I lie: and I lie till I don't know who I am\nAnd then I tell myself\n\nFergie\nNo no no no: baby: no no no no: don't lie (don't you lie!)\n'Cause you know-know-know-know: yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try (you know: you know you gotta)\nWhat you're gonna do when it all comes out?\nWhen I really see you and what you're all about?\nNo no no no: baby: no no no no: don't lie\n\nNo no no no: baby: no no no no\n(Stop: st-stop: stop: st-stop: stop lying)",

I said girls...\n\nI ain't as good as I once was\nI got a few years on me now\nBut there was a time: back in my prime\nWhen I could really lay it down\nIf you need some love tonight\nThen I might have just enough\nI ain't as good as I once was: but I'm as good once\nAs I ever was\n\nI still hang out with my best friend Dave\nI've known him since we were kids at school\nLast night he had a few shots: got in a tight spot\nHustlin' a game of pool\nWith a couple of redneck boys\nOne great big fat biker man\nI heard David yell across the room\nHey buddy: how 'bout a helpin' hand... I said Dave...\n\nI ain't as good as I once was\nMy how the years have flown\nBut there was a time: back in my prime\nWhen I could really hold my own\nIf you want to fight tonight\nGuess them boys don't look all that tough\nI ain't as good as I once was: but I'm as good once\nAs I ever was\n\nI used to be hell on wheels\nBack when I was a younger man\nNow my body says you can't do this boy\nBut my pride says oh yes you can...\n\nI ain't as good as I once was\nThat's just the cold hard truth\nI still throw a few back: talk a little smack\nWhen I'm feelin' bullet proof\nSo don't double-dog dare me now\n'Cause I might have to call your bluff\nI ain't as good as I once was: but I'm as good once\nAs I ever was\n\nI ain't as good as I once was: but I'm as good once\nAs I ever was",

Big boi: Lil Jon!\nSending this out to all the ladies that got beef with another bitch\nUh huh: just walk to that bitch and tell her: whatcha' tell her?\n\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\n\nThere she go talkin' her mess\nAll around town making me stress:\nI need to get this off my chest\nAnd if her friend want some then she'll be next\nIt really ain't that complicated\nY'all walk around looking all frustrated\nWant some plex come on let's make it\nYa acting real hard but I know ya fakin'\n\nKnow you really don't wanna step to this\nReally don't know why you talk this shit\nYou about to catch one right in the lip\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\nKnow you really don't wanna step to this\nReally don't know why you talk this shit\nYou about to catch one right in the lip\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\n\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\n\nWe on our way to ya neighborhood\nThe reason why we comin' is understood\nMe and my girls we down to ride\nSo when you hear us pull up bring ya butt outside\nAnd if you try to call yo cousin and nem\nDon't forget that I got some of dem\nBout to go real hard bout to swang dem thangs\nBout to feel elbows all in ya brain\n\nKnow you really don't wanna step to this\nReally don't know why you talk this shit\nYou about to catch one right in the lip\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\n\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\n\nOh I know you don't want me to split ya dome\nGirl you makin' me really mad...\nOh I know you don't want me to split ya dome\nI'm about to bruise ya face and it's sad...\n\n(Big Boi)\nOh snap: these bitches they act like cats\nIn the middle of the dance floor now they preparing to scrap\nThey takin' out their scrunchies and pullin off their press-ons\nThe one on the right is the girlfriend and the one the left is another woman\nSomeone please call securty: these girls too perty:\nTo get down to the nitty titty\nI mean the nitty gritty\nI mean her titties pretty\nI'm trippin' being silly willy: man don't let them hoes fight\n\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nWe bout to throw dem bows\nWe bout to swing dem thangs\nIt's about to be a what? Girlfight!\n\nDon't act like you don't know\nWe right outside yo door\nSee you peekin' out the window\nI know you ain't talking noise no more\nDon't act like you don't know\nWe right outside yo door\nSee you peekin' out the window\nI know you ain't talking noise no more\nBitch come outside\n\n(Subliminal!)\nDon't act like you don't see me\nIt's about to be a...

(I'll be loving you)\n\nWanna keep you flawed with no dough\nPimpin' ain't easy\nTrust me I know\nWhen gangstas and hos\nGo go go go go go together\nLike chinchilla and bad weather\nI'm good but been better\nAll my bros: chedda and glamorous things\nCopped a few cars\nA crib with a east and west wing\n'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets\nOf how to get it and keep it\nHow to prey on my weakness\nIt's the power of the p-u-s-s-y\nGot a lotta niggas wonderin it ain't just i\nGotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life\nIf it wasn't for the money and the things I got\nShit: she probably wouldn't like me\nBut I keep her and irv and Jeffrey quite icy\nSip seraphin\nWho doesn't like me\nAnd the murderous I-n-c\n\nIf it wasn't for the money: cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I got\nI wonder: hey\nWould you still want me (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\n\nHow many girls does it take to get to\nMack status?\nPlayer status?\nPimps that get\nYa boy half rich fore we hit show biz\nBut show biz brought next level chicks\nPull them in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga\nI came from the dirt what you want me to say\nI'm at the top of the world and lifes a pussy buffet\nAnd that's why I get m-i-a\nShut the game down so the bustas can't play\nHell yeah I splurge money\nHell yeah I act funny\nLook at you like fuck you\nAll the shit I been through\nIt's a wonder why I'm still here\nSaid I was gone but I'm still here\nAnd all you bitches that left me here\nIt's mighty strange how you right back here\n\nIf it wasn't for the money: cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I got\nI wonder: hey\nWould you still want me (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\n\nI wonder why love is about money\nAnd why wou wanna take it all from me\nHoney\nMy life is dark but it's lovely\nCrimes cars cribs ain't that right Kelly?\n(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)\nY'all bitches don't know\nMoney ain't a thang\nMami need a lil change\nGirl I'm pitchin quarters\nClosest to the arches but live in a fortress\nNew Benzes new Porsches\nNew cases new lawyers\nI'm becoming the infamous notorious rule\nNiggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\nNiggas don't possess the heart that I do\nAnd it's a wonder that I'm still here\nThought I was gone but I'm still here\nAnd all you bitches that left me here\nIt's kinda funny how you right back there\n\nIf it wasn't for the money: cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I got\nI wonder: hey\nWould you still want me (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me?

Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)\nIt gets meaner and meaner each time baby\nFeelin' real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face!\n(Yeah)\nI'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)\nSome would rather run down and get one cow (nah)\nI think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all\nYou know what I'm talkin' 'bout right? Look\n\nI'm never going nowhere so don't try me\nMy music sticks in fans veins like an IV\nFlows poison like Ivy: oh they grimy\nAlready offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me\nRespected highly: HIIII MR. O'REILLY\nHope all is well: kiss the plaintiff and the wifey\nDrove through the window: the industry super sized me\nNow the girls see me and a river's what they cry me\nI'm on the rise: so many people despise me\nGot party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)\nIt's a celebration and everyone should invite me\nRoll with the crew or meet the bottom of my Nikes (blaow!)\nExplorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me\nMy whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee\nNobody light-skinded rapping harder since Ice-T\nYou disagree: take the Tyson approach and bite me!\n\nWhoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)\nI'm comin' for that number one spot! (All right)\nRappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh: uh uh)\nBut I'm coming for they number one spot! (All right man)\nScheme scheme: plot plot (say WHAT?)\nI'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo: hey)\nKeep it going it won't stop! (What you doing man?)\nI'm comin' for that number one spot!\n\nYes indeed: Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada\nReady to break the steering column on your Impala\nIf I get caught: bail out: po'-po' I tell them holla\nIn court I never show up: like Austin Powers fa-zha\nFather: father: and hey I love gold\nBut can buy anything I want from the records I've sold\nJacuzzi's hot: Cristal is so cold\nNeighbors catch contacts: from the blunts that I've rolled\nA pig in a blanket: a smoke and a pancake\nDrop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake\nI crush mics until my hand breaks\nThen shag now and shag later until these women can't stand straight\nThe Luda-meister got 'em feelin' so randy\nI'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+\nBrush my shoulder and I pop my collar\n'Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars\n\nWhoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)\nI'm comin' for that number one spot! (All right)\nRappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh: uh uh)\nBut I'm coming for they number one spot! (All right man)\nScheme scheme: plot plot (say WHAT?)\nI'm coming for that number one spot! (Woo: hey)\nKeep it going it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)\nI'm comin' for that number one spot!\n\nCausing lyrical disasters: it's the master\nMake music for Mini-Me's: models and Fat Bastards\nThese women trying yo get me out my Pelle Pelle\nThey strip off my clothes and tell me: \"Get in my belly!\"\nStay on the track: hit the ground running like Flo-Jo\nSent back in time and I've never lost my mojo\nLadies and gentlemen ah: boys and girls\nLudacris sit down and take over the whole world!\n\nWhoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)\nI'm coming for that number one spot! (All right)\nRappers swearing they on top! (Nuh uh: uh uh)\nBut I'm coming' for they number one spot!

Bun B)\n\n(Oh) Girl give me that\n(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that\nGirl give me that (pussy)\n(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that\nGirl give me that (pussy)\n(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that there\nGirl give me that pussy\n(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that\n\n(Lil Webbie) - Verse 1\nYou know you want it\nGirl don't act like you don't want it\nGirl I want it just as bad as you do\nAnd look see I can tell from this lil vibe\nYou got me feeling that you dig me\nBoo I'm digging you too\nYou wanna be one of the chosen few\nThen gon jig up in this motherfucker\nMaybe me and you can do it big up in this motherfucker\nSit you in a crib where you can chill\nDon't have to move a muscle\nGive you some be good now you be good\nDaddy gon hustle\nCome here let me Whisper in your ear\nI gotta tell you something\nListening to this song kinda make a nigga want something\nDid some daydreaming\nNow I'm fiending like I'm on something\nGirl don't hold it from me\nCause right now I'll be don strong on ya\nI ain't the type to ruin your life\nBy running game and throwing your dreams\nGet in your brain suit your game\nEase your pain and show you things\nSit you on some leather seats while blowing green\nAnd switching lanes\nGirl stop playing games let me beat it out the frame\n\n(Chorus - repeat 4X)\nGirl give me that pussy\nGirl give me that\nGirl give me girl give me that there\n\n(Bun B from UGK) - Verse 2\nShe five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds\nThirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown\nBad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute\nSince the All-Star game and I'm still tryin' to hit it\nGot a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things\nHe caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change\nShe sold all his jewels she sold all his cars\nNow she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars\nSliding down the pole slow drop it to a split\nPussy popping on a handstand man she the shit\nShe still looking tight though\nStill built right though\nRun my game right and after the club\nShe might go back to the telly with me\nShake her jelly with me\nLet my people bust on her face and her belly with me\nI got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating\nWe some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating\n\n(Chorus - repeat 4X)\nGirl give me that pussy\nGirl give me that\nGirl give me girl give me that there\n\n(Lil Webbie) - Verse 3\nNow I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire\nSo I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require\nFor you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs\nLong sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes\nYou a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it\nLook like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy\nLet me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie\nI might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody\nLook you know you want it\nGirl don't act like you don't want it\nGirl you want it just as bad as I do\nBut check this out\nYou gon be wishing that you been gave me your money\nBy the time I finish rumbling with you\nWhile rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room\nAnd you just keep yourself excited till we get to the room\n'Cause I've been rocked up since I met you\nI'm ready to give you the blues\nDon't stunt now take off your shoes\nDon't act confused you know what time it is\n\n(Chorus - repeat 4X)\nGirl give me that pussy\nGirl give me that\nGirl give me girl give me that there",
