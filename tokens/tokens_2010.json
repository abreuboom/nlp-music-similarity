Diddy (hey: what up girl?)\nGrab my glasses: I'm out the door: I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)\nBefore I leave: brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack\n'Cause when I leave for the night: I ain't coming back\n\nI'm talking pedicure on our toes: toes\nTryin' on all our clothes: clothes\nBoys blowing up our phones: phones\nDrop-topping: playing our favorite CDs\nPullin' up to the parties\nTrying to get a little bit tipsy\n\nDon't stop: make it pop\nDJ: blow my speakers up\nTonight: I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop: no\nOh: woah: oh: oh\nOh: woah: oh: oh\n\nDon't stop: make it pop\nDJ: blow my speakers up\nTonight: I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop: no\nOh: woah: oh: oh\nOh: woah: oh: oh\n\nAin't got a care in world: but got plenty of beer\nAin't got no money in my pocket: but I'm already here\nAnd now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger\nBut we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger\n\nI'm talking about everybody getting crunk: crunk\nBoys trying to touch my junk: junk\nGonna smack him if he getting too drunk: drunk\nNow: now: we goin' till they kick us out: out\nOr the police shut us down: down\nPolice shut us down: down\nPo-po shut us\n\nDon't stop: make it pop\nDJ: blow my speakers up\nTonight: I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop: no\nOh: woah: oh: oh\nOh: woah: oh: oh\n\nDon't stop: make it pop\nDJ: blow my speakers up\nTonight: I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop: no\nOh: woah: oh: oh\nOh: woah: oh: oh\n\nDJ: you build me up\nYou break me down\nMy heart: it pounds\nYeah: you got me\n\nWith my hands up\nYou got me now\nYou got that sound\nYeah: you got me\n\nDJ: you build me up\nYou break me down\nMy heart: it pounds\nYeah: you got me\n\nWith my hands up\nPut your hands up\nPut your hands up\nNow the party don't start till I walk in\n\nDon't stop: make it pop\nDJ: blow my speakers up\nTonight: I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop: no\nOh: woah: oh: oh\nOh: woah: oh: oh\n\nDon't stop: make it pop\nDJ: blow my speakers up\nTonight: I'mma fight\nTill we see the sunlight\n\nTik tok on the clock\nBut the party don't stop: no\nOh: woah: oh: oh\nOh: woah: oh: oh",

No one knows\nI realized: yeah: it was only just a dream\n\nI was at the top: and now it's like I&#x2019;m in the basement\nNumber one spot: now she found her a replacement\nI swear: now I can't take it\nKnowin' somebody's got my baby\nAnd now you ain't around: baby: I can't think\nI shoulda' put it down: shoulda' got that ring\n'Cause I can still feel it in the air\nSee her pretty face: run my fingers through her hair\n\nMy lover: my life\nMy shawty: my wife\nShe left me: I'm tight\n'Cause I know that it just ain't right\n\nI was thinkin' 'bout her: thinkin' 'bout me\nThinkin' 'bout us: what we gon' be\nOpened my eyes: yeah: it was only just a dream\nSo I traveled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realized: yeah: it was only just a dream\n\nWhen I be ridin': man: I swear I see her face at every turn\nTryin' to get my Usher on: but I can't let it burn\nAnd I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for\nMore and more I miss her: when will I learn?\nDidn't give her all my love: I guess now I got my payback\nNow I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby\nHey: she was so easy to love\nBut wait: I guess that love wasn't enough\nI'm going through it every time that I'm alone\nAnd now I'm missing: wishing she'd pick up the phone\nBut she made the decision that she wanted to move on\n'Cause I was wrong\n\nAnd I was thinkin' 'bout her: thinkin' 'bout me\nThinkin' 'bout us: what we gon' be\nOpened my eyes: yeah: it was only just a dream\nSo: I traveled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realized: yeah: it was only just a dream\n\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything\nI said: if you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything\n\nI was thinkin' 'bout her: thinkin' 'bout me\nThinkin' 'bout us: what we gon' be\nOpened my eyes: yeah: it was only just a dream\nSo: I traveled back down that road\nWill she come back?

(x8)\nGo low: (Go low) lower than you know (x4)\n\nI be like Nick-nac-paddywac\nOh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone\nHow many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home\nI could make me show stop\nSoon as you hear this flow pop\nFrom A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop\nPut the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini\nAnd if she really gettin' low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV\n'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel\nBut when it comes to chocolate\nI know that very well\nAsian persuasion\nNo discrimination\nI love how they seem to please us\nI wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces\n'Cause I think you a superstar\nWith a ass like that you gotta blow\nBefore you make it big\nWell there just one thing that I gotta know\n\nHow low can you go? (x8)\nGo low: (Go low) lower than you know (x4)\n\nDrop it: hit it: dump it: split it\nDon't stop (Get it: get it)\nPut it on reverse just to back it up\nLet me put some Luda in it\nShow me what you workin wit\nI'll show you some of this bank roll\nYeah you a superstar there's just one thing I gotta know so\n\nHow low can you go? (x8)\nGo low: (Go low) lower than you know (x4)",

Guetta... let's get 'em!)\n\nHey\nI own the night and I don't need no help\nGotta be the feeling that Scarface felt\nStuntin' go wild: can't handle this playa\nLife of the club: arrogant like yeah!\nTalk like money: so the girls just melt\nOne too many: all on me like Twelve\nLook like cash and they all just stare\nBottles: Models: standin' on chairs\nFall out 'cause that's the business\nAll out: it's so ridiculous\nZone out: so much attention\nScream out \"I'm in the building\" (hey!)\nThey watchin': I know this\nI'm rockin': I'm rolling\nI'm holding: I know it\nYou know it\n\nFlo Rida and Nicole Scherzinger:\nYou know I know how\nTo make 'em stop and stare as I zone out\nThe club can't even handle me right now\nWatchin you watchin me I go all out\nThe club can't even handle me right now (yeah)\nThe club can't even handle me right now (yeah)\n\nFlo Rida:\nHey\nStill feelin' myself: I'm like outta control\nCan't stop now: more shots: let's go\nTen more rounds: till I get a KO\nPaparazzi trying to make me pose\nCame to party till I can't no more\nCelebrate 'cause that's all I know\nTip the groupies takin' off their clothes\nGrand finale: like The Superbowl\nGo hard: I run the show\nThat's right: while I got money to blow\nMore lights: more ice: when I walk in the door\nNo hype: do it big all over the globe\nYeah!\nI said it\nGo tell it\nConfetti\nWho's ready?\nI'm ready!\nYou ready!?\nLet's get it!\n\nFlo Rida and Nicole Scherzinger:\nYou know I know how\nTo make 'em stop and stare as I zone out\nThe club can't even handle me right now\nWatchin' you watchin' me I go all out\nThe club can't even handle me right now (yeah)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\nThe club can't even handle me right now (yeah)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n\nFlo Rida:\nYou got me watchin now (hey)\nGot my attention now (hey)\nGot everybody in the club wanting to know now\nI am a ladies man\nCome be my lady and...\nWe can both zone out\nBring ya body and let me switch up your atmosphere\nTake you out of da club and up in my new Lear\nFly you around the world\nWhat you want baby girl\nAre you ready to go now!\n\nFlo Rida and Nicole Scherzinger:\nYou know I know how\nTo make 'em stop and stare as I zone out\nThe club can't even handle me right now\nWatchin' you watchin' me I go all out\nThe club can't even handle me right now (yeah)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\nThe club can't even handle me right now (yeah)\n(Put yo' hands up!)\nLet's celebrate now\n(Put yo' hands up!)\nYou know who shut 'em down!",

Girl: quit playing\nWe're just friends: what are you saying?\nSay there's another and look right in my eyes\nMy first love broke my heart for the first time\nAnd I was like...\n\nBaby: baby: baby ooh\nLike baby: baby: baby no\nLike baby: baby: baby ooh\nI thought you'd always be mine (mine)\n\nBaby: baby: baby ooh\nLike baby: baby: baby no\nLike baby: baby: baby ooh\nI thought you'd always be mine (mine)\n\nOh: for you I would have done whatever\nAnd I just can't believe we ain't together\nAnd I wanna play it cool: but I'm losin' you\nI'll buy you anything: I'll buy you any ring\nAnd I'm in pieces: baby fix me\nAnd just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream\nI'm going down: down: down: down\nAnd I just can't believe my first love won't be around\n\nAnd I'm like\nBaby: baby: baby ooh\nLike baby: baby: baby no\nLike baby: baby: baby ooh\nI thought you'd always be mine (mine)\n\nBaby: baby: baby ooh\nLike baby: baby: baby no\nLike baby: baby: baby ooh\nI thought you'd always be mine (mine)\n\nLudacris\nLuda! When I was 13: I had my first love\nThere was nobody that compared to my baby\nAnd nobody came between us or could ever come above\nShe had me going crazy: oh: I was star-struck\nShe woke me up daily: don't need no Starbucks\nShe made my heart pound: it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and\nAt school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend\nShe knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing\nAnd now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...\n\nJustin Bieber\nBaby: baby: baby ooh\nLike baby: baby: baby no\nLike baby: baby: baby ooh\nI thought you'd always be mine (mine)\n\nBaby: baby: baby ooh\nLike baby: baby: baby no\nLike baby: baby: baby ooh\nI thought you'd always be mine (mine)\n\nI'm gone (yeah yeah yeah: yeah yeah yeah)\nNow I'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah: yeah yeah yeah)\nNow I'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah: yeah yeah yeah)\nNow I'm all gone (gone: gone: gone...)\nI'm gone",

(hold on)\nYes: yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)\nYes: yes: I can see it (come on: come on)\nI can see it now",

What am I doin'?\nOh yeah that's right\nI'm doin' me: I'm doin' me\nI'm livin' life right now: man\nAnd this is what imma do until it's over\nTill it's over: but it's far from over\n\nAll right bottles on me: long as imma drink it\nNever drop the ball: fuck are y'all thinkin'?\nMakin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'\n'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett\n\nI shouldn't have drove: tell me how I'm gettin' home\nYou too fine to be layin' down in bed alone\nI can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone\nI swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known\n\n'Bout to go Thriller: Mike Jackson on these niggas\nAll I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers\nSuper good Smir-do': a package of the Swishers\nI did overnight: it couldn't have happened any quicker\n\nY'all know them? Well fuck it me either\nPoint the biggest skeptic out: I'll make him a believer\nIt wouldn't be the first time I done it\nThrowin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones\nBitch I run it\n\nI know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year\nWho the fuck are y'all?\nI swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back\nBut I just can't remember at all\n\nWhat am I doin'? What am I doin'?\nOh yeah that's right\nI'm doin' me: I'm doin' me\nI'm livin' life right now. man\nAnd this is what imma do until it's over\nTill it's over: but it's far from over\n\nOne thing about music when it hit you feel no pain\nI swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane\nSo they tell me that they love me I know better than that\nIt's just game\nIt's just what comes with the fame\n\nAnd I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'\nBut I really can't complain\nEverything is Kosher\nTwo thumbs up: Ebert and Roeper\nI really can't see the end gettin' any closer\n\nBut I probably still be the man when everything is over\nSo I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on\nCan you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on\nY'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on\nAnd if you thinkin' imma quit before I die: dream on\n\nThey treat me like a legend: am I really this cold?\nI'm really too young to be feelin' this old\nIt's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?\nNobody's ever done it like I did it\n\nI know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year\nWho the fuck are y'all?\nI swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back\nBut I just can't remember at all\n\nWhat am I doin'? What am I doin'?\nOh yeah that's right\nI'm doin' me: I'm doin' me\nI'm livin' life right now: man\nAnd this is what imma do until it's over\nTill it's over: but it's far from over",

Just like Akon:\n'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...\n\nShawty: I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)\nAnd for your lovin': I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis...

        "Lyrics": "It may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\n\nLast name Ever: first name Greatest\nLike a sprained ankle: boy: I ain't nothin' to play with\nStarted off local: but thanks to all the haters\nI know G4 pilots on a first-name basis\nIn your city faded off the brown: Nino\nShe insists she got more class: we know\nSwimming in the money: come and find me: Nemo\nIf I was at the club you know I balled: chemo\nDropped a mix tape: that shit sounded like an album\nWho'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome\nLabels want my name beside an X like Malcolm\nEverybody got a deal: I did it without one\nYeah: nigga: I'm about my business\nKillin' all these rappers: you would swear I had a hit list\nEveryone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness\nIf you ain't been a part of it: at least you got to witness\nBitches\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\n\nEver: ever: Mr. West is in the buildin'\nAin't no question who about to kill 'em\nI used to have hood dreams: Big fame: big chains\nI stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came\nAnd went hard all fall like the ball teams\nJust so I could make it rain all spring\nY'all seen my story: my glory\nI had raped the game young: you could call it statutory\nWhen a nigga blow up: they gon' build statues for me\nOld money: Benjamin Button: what: nothin'\nNah: super bad chicks giving me McLovin'\nYou would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband\nYou would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't\nLike they was down with the old me: no: you fuckin' wasn't\n\"Uh: you such a fuckin' loser\nYou ain't even go to class: Bueller\"\nTrade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back\n'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?\nChasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac\nAll the way in Hollywood and I can't even act\nThey pull they cameras out: and God damn: they snap\nI used to want this thing forever: you can have it back\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\n\nOkay: hello: it's the Martian: Space Jam Jordans\nI want this shit forever: wake up and smell the garden\nFresher than the harvest: step up to the target\nIf I had one guess: then I guess I'm just New Orleans\nAnd I will never stop: like I'm runnin' from the cops\nHopped up in my car and told my chauffeur \"To the top\"\nLife is such a fuckin' roller coaster: then it drops\nBut what should I scream for? This is my theme park\nMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side: you don't want to hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk: check the price and pay attention\nLil Wayne: that's what they got to say or mention\nI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer\nI'm resting in the lead: I need a pillow and a cover\nShhh: my foot's sleepin' on the gas\nNo brake pads: no such thing as last\nUh: uh\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\n\nThere they go: packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow\nNuts they go: Macadamian: they go so ballistic: whoa\nHe can make them look like bozos: he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow\nFuck no: go for broke: his cup just runneth over: oh: no\nHe ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed\nThey been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before\nBashin' in the brains of these hoes: and establishin' a name as he goes\nThe passion and the flame is ignited: you can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot\nYou dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'\nAnd spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths: now rewind it\nPayback: motherfucker: for the way that you got at me: how's it taste:\nWhen I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?\nI'm Hannibal Lector: so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face\nYou ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place: so Drake\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)",

Yeah\nWe the best!\n\nAll I do is win win win no matter what\nGot money on my mind: I can never get enough\nAnd every time I step up in the building\nEverybody hands go up\nAnd they stay there: and they stay there\nAnd they stay there - up down up down up down\n'Cause all I do is win: win: win\nAnd if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air: make 'em stay there!\n\nYeah: listen: Luda!\nLudacris goin' in on the verse\n'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now\nKeep your hands up: get 'em in the sky\nFor the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down\nI never went nowhere: but they sayin' \"Luda's back\"\nBlame it on that conjure: the hood call it Luda 'gnac\nAnd I'm on this foolish track: so I spit my foolish flow\nMy hands go up and down: like strippers' booties go\nMy verses still be servin': tight like a million virgins\nLast time on the Khaled remix: now I'm on the original version\nCan't never count me out: y'all better count me in\nGot twenty bank accounts: accountants count me in\nMake millions every year (yeah) the South's champion (yeah)\n'Cause all I do: all I - all I - all I - all I do is\nAy: woo!\n\nAll I do is win win win no matter what\nGot money on my mind: I can never get enough\nAnd every time I step up in the building\nEverybody hands go up\nAnd they stay there: and they stay there\nAnd they stay there - up down up down up down\n'Cause all I do is win: win: win\nAnd if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air: make 'em stay there!\n\nWin: win: who? Boss\nBoss: swervin' in my lo-lo\nHead on the swivel: you know serving me's a no-no\nClean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce\nYellow bone passenger: they see it they say \"oh boy\"\nTell Khaled back it up: my niggas call me loco\nDown for armed trafficking: don't make me pull that fo'-fo'\nAsk you what you laughing at - represent that mud life!\nDirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right!\nWe come together holdin' hands and holla \"thug life\"\nWe all strapped in all black: it's like fuck life (all we do is win!)\nYou riding to what (What!) 'cause we riding tonight (tonight!)\nNow she riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding her right\nRoss!\n\nAll I do is win win win no matter what\nGot money on my mind: I can never get enough\nAnd every time I step up in the building\nEverybody hands go up\nAnd they stay there: and they stay there\nAnd they stay there - up down up down up down\n'Cause all I do is win: win: win\nAnd if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air: make 'em stay there!\n\nHeat in the kitchen: pot on the stove\nWater gettin' boiled: dope being sold\nSnoopy in the hoopty: system overload\nI been running this rap game since I was 20 years old\nI hung with the worst of 'em: bust till I burst 'em up\nFloss 'em up: toss 'em up: Hardaway: boss 'em up\nPardon me: I'm bossing up: pressure up: bless you bruh\nDon't mess with us: we like the you in the 80's\nBack to back: set a trap: hit the lick: hit it back\nHit the trick: jump the track: bitch I want my money back\nTime and time again while I'm sipping on this gin\nAl Davis said it best: \"Just win baby: win!\"\n\nAll I do is win win win no matter what\nGot money on my mind: I can never get enough\nAnd every time I step up in the building\nEverybody hands go up\nAnd they stay there: and they stay there\nAnd they stay there - up down up down up down\n'Cause all I do is win: win: win\nAnd if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air: make 'em stay there!",

I'm with Marley G: bro\nFlying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows\nAnd I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know\nThis that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow\nAnd uh: my real friends never hearin' from me\nFake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me\nThat's why I pick and choose: I don't get shit confused\nI got a small circle: I'm not with different crews\nWe walk the same path: but got on different shoes\nLive in the same building: but we got different views\nI got a couple cars I never get to use\nDon't like my women single: I like my chicks in twos\nAnd these days all the girls is down to roll\nI hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole\nPlus I been sippin': so this shit is movin' kinda slow\nJust tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go\n\nLil Wayne\nNow tell me how you love it\nYou know you at the top when only heaven's right above it\nWe on\nIt's Young Money: motherfucker\nIf you ain't runnin' wit it: run from it: motherfucker: all right\n\nNow somebody show some money in this bitch\nAnd I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch: ya dig?\nI got my gun in my boo purse\nAnd I don't bust back: because I shoot first\n\nMeet me on the fresh train\nYes: I'm in the building: you just on the list of guest names\nAnd all of my riders do not give a fuck: X Games\nGuns turn you boys into pussies: sex change\nAnd I smoke till I got chest pains\nAnd you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James\nWomen are possessive: and they wanna possess Wayne\nI been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane\nSkinny pants and some Vans\nCall me Triple A: get my advance in advance: amen\nAs the world spin and dance in my hands\nLife is a beach: I'm just playin' in the sand\nUh: wake up and smell the pussy\nYou niggas can't see me: but never overlook me\nI'm on the paper trail: it ain't no tellin' where it took me\nYeah: and I ain't a killa: but don't push me\n\nNow tell me how you love it\nYou know you at the top when only heaven's right above it\nWe on\nIt's Young Money: motherfucker\nIf you ain't runnin' wit it: run from it: motherfucker: all right\n\nNow somebody show some money in this bitch\nAnd I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch: ya dig?\nI got my gun in my boo purse\nAnd I don't bust back: because I shoot first\n\nUh: how do he say what's never said?\nBeautiful black woman: I bet that bitch look better red\nLimpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg\nMa'fuckin' Birdman Junior: eleventh grade\nBall on automatic start\nI could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw\nWildcat offense: check the paw prints\nWe in the building: you niggas in apartments\nNo-now: c'mon: be my blood donor\nFlo' so nice: you ain't gotta put a rug on her\nDo it big: and let the small fall under that\nDamn: where you stumbled out?
