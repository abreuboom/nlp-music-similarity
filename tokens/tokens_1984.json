(So cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding\nMaybe I'm just like my father: too bold\n\nMaybe you're just like my mother\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other?\nThis is what it sounds like when doves cry\n\nTouch if you will my stomach\nFeel how it trembles inside\nYou've got the butterflies all tied up\nDon't make me chase you: even doves have pride\n\nHow could you just leave me standing\nAlone in a world so cold? (World so cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding\nMaybe I'm just like my father: too bold\n\nMaybe you're just like my mother\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other?\nThis is what it sounds like when doves cry\n\nHow can you just leave me standing\nAlone in a world that's so cold? (World is so cold)\nMaybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe: maybe)\nMaybe I'm just like my father: too bold\n(I'm like my father: you know: you know he's too bold)\n\nMaybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)\nShe's never satisfied (Never: never satisfied)\nWhy do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream: why?)\nThis is what it sounds like when doves cry\n\nWhen doves cry: when doves cry: when doves cry\nWhen doves cry: when doves cry: when doves cry\nWhen doves cry: when doves cry: when doves cry\n\nWhen doves cry\nDon't cry\nDarling: don't cry\nDon't cry: don't cry: don't don't cry",

Ooh\n\nI've been taking on a new direction\nBut I have to say\nI've been thinking about my own protection\nIt scares me to feel this way\n\nOh: what's love got to do\nGot to do with it?\nWhat's love but a second-hand emotion?\nWhat's love got to do\nGot to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n(What's love) got to do\nGot to do do with it?\nWhat's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?\nWhat's love got to do\nGot to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n(What's love got to do)\nOoh: got to do do with it?\n(What's love but a sweet second-hand emotion?)\nWhat's love got to do got to do\nGot to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?",

(what's it all for)\nBetter live now\nBefore the grim reaper comes knocking on your door\nTell me baby\n\nAre we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh: no: let's go\n\nLet's go crazy: let's get nuts\nLook for the purple banana\n'Til they put us in the truck\nLet's go!\n\nCome on: baby\nLet's get nuts!\nYeah: crazy\n\nLet's go crazy\n\nAre we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?\nOh: no: let's go\n\nGo crazy\nWoo! Huh!\nI said: let's go (go) crazy (crazy)\nLet's go (let's go)\nLet's go (let's go)\n\nDr. Everything'll-Be-Alright\nMake everything go wrong\nPills and thrills and daffodils will kill\nHang tough children\n\nHe's coming\nHe's coming\nComing\n\nTake me away!",

And\n\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nAnd I have no privacy: whoa\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nTell me: is it just a dream?\n\nWhen I come home at night\nI bang the door real tight\nPeople call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid\nOr can the people on TV see me: or am I just paranoid?\nWhen I'm in the shower: I'm afraid to wash my hair\n'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there\nPeople say I'm crazy: just a little touched\nBut maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much\nThat's why\n\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nAnd I have no privacy: whoa\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nWho's playing tricks on me?\n\nWho's watching me?\nI don't know anymore!\nAre the neighbors watching me?\nWho's watching?\nWell: is the mailman watching me?\nTell me: who's watching?\nAnd I don't feel safe anymore: oh: what a mess\nI wonder who's watching me now\nWho?\nThe IRS?!\n\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nAnd I have no privacy: whoa\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nTell me is it just a dream\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nAnd I have no privacy: whoa (hee hee hee)\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nWho's playing tricks on me?\nWho's watching me?\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nOoh: whoa\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nTell me: can it be? (hee hee hee)\nWho's watching me?\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nWhoa\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nWho's playing tricks on me?\nWho's watching me?\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nCan I have my privacy?\nWhoa\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nWho's playing tricks on me?",

Diamonds and furs.\nLove would only conquer my head.\"\n\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much\n\nThey made haste in the brown sedan\nThey drove to 55 Secret Street\nThey made love and by the seventh wave\nShe knew she had a problem\n\nShe thought real love is real scary\nMoney only pays the rent\nLove is forever: that's all your life\nLove is heaven sent: it's glamorous\n\nLead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much\n\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much: it ain't much\n\nLead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much: it ain't much\n\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much: it ain't much\n\nLead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much: it ain't much\n\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nShe don't need a man's touch\nShe wants to lead the glamorous life\nWithout love it ain't much: it ain't much\nOoh: oh",

Who's the game?\nI feel the beat call your name\nI hold you close in victory\nI don't wanna tame your animal style\nYou won't be caged from the call of the wild\n\nShootin' at the walls of heartache\nBang: bang\nI am the warrior\nWell: I am the warrior\nAnd heart to heart you'll win\nIf you survive\nThe warrior\nThe warrior\nI am the warrior\n\nShootin' at the walls of heartache\n(Shootin' at the walls of heartache)\nThe warrior\nI am the warrior\nAnd heart to heart you'll win\nHeart to heart you'll win\nIf you survive\nThe warrior\nThe warrior\n\nShootin' at the walls of heartache\nBang: bang\nI am the warrior\nYes: I am the warrior\nAnd victory is mine\n\n(Shootin' at the walls of heartache)\nThe warrior\nI am the warrior\n\nShootin' at the walls of heartache\nBang: bang\nI am the warrior",

        "Lyrics": "It's close to midnight: and something evil's lurking in the dark\nUnder the moonlight: you see a sight that almost stops your heart\nYou try to scream: but terror takes the sound before you make it\nYou start to freeze: as horror looks you right between the eyes\nYou're paralyzed\n\n'Cause this is thriller: thriller night \nAnd no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike\nYou know it's thriller: thriller night\nYou're fighting for your life inside a: killer: thriller tonight: yeah\n\nYou hear the door slam: and realize there's nowhere left to run\nYou feel the cold hand: and wonder if you'll ever see the sun\nYou close your eyes: and hope that this is just imagination (Girl)\nBut all the while: you hear a creature creeping up behind\nYou're out of time\n\n'Cause this is thriller: thriller night\nThere ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes: girl\n(Thriller: thriller night)\nYou're fighting for your life inside a killer: thriller tonight\n\nNight creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade\nThere's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time\n(They're open wide)\nThis is the end of your life \n\nThey're out to get you: there's demons closing in on every side\nThey will possess you: unless you change that number on your dial\nNow is the time: for you and I to cuddle close together (Yeah)\nAll through the night: I'll save you from the terror on the screen\nI'll make you see\n\nThat this is thriller: thriller night\n'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try\n(Thriller: thriller night)\nSo let me hold you tight and share a killer: diller: chiller: thriller here tonight\n\n'Cause this is thriller: thriller night\nGirl: I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try\n(Thriller: thriller night)\nSo let me hold you tight and share a killer: thriller\n\nI'm gonna thrill you tonight\n\nDarkness falls across the land\nThe midnight hour is close at hand\nCreatures crawl in search of blood\nTo terrorize y'all's neighborhood\nAnd whomsoever shall be found\nWithout the soul for getting down\nMust stand and face the hounds of hell\nAnd rot inside a corpse's shell\n\nI'm gonna thrill you tonight\nOoh: baby \nI'm gonna thrill you tonight\nOh: darling \nI'm gonna thrill you tonight \nOoh: baby \nI'm gonna thrill you tonight \nOh: darling \nThriller night: baby \n\nThe foulest stench is in the air \nThe funk of forty-thousand years \nAnd grisly ghouls from every tomb \nAre closing in to seal your doom \nAnd though you fight to stay alive \nYour body starts to shiver \nFor no mere mortal can resist \nThe evil of the thriller",

Somethin' to see: baby\nAin't that America? Home of the free: yeah\nLittle pink houses for you and me\nOoh yeah: for you and me\n\nWell: there's a young man in a t-shirt\nListenin' to a rockin' rollin' station\nHe's got greasy hair: greasy smile\nHe says: \"Lord this must be my destination\"\n'Cause they told me when I was younger\nSaid: \"Boy: you're gonna be president\"\nBut just like everything else those old crazy dreams\nJust kinda came and went\n\nAh: but ain't that America for you and me?\nAin't that America? Somethin' to see: baby\nAin't that America? Home of the free: yeah\nLittle pink houses for you and me\nAh: yeah: baby: for you and me\n\nWell: there's people and more people\nWhat do they know know know?\nGo to work in some high rise\nAnd vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico: ooh yeah\nAnd there's winners and there's losers\nBut they ain't no big deal\n'Cause the simple man: baby: pays for the thrills: the bills\nThe pills that kill\n\nAh: but ain't that America for you and me?\nAin't that America?
