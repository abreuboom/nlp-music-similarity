        "Lyrics": "In a little while from now\nIf I'm not feeling any less sour\nI promise myself to treat myself\nAnd visit a nearby tower\n\nAnd climbing to the top\nWill throw myself off\nIn an effort to make clear to whomever\nWhat it's like when you're shattered\n\nLeft standing in the lurch \nAt a church where people saying \nMy God: that's tough: she stood him up\nNo point in us remaining \n\nWe may as well go home\nAs I did on my own\nAlone again: naturally\n\nTo think that only yesterday\nI was cheerful: bright and gay\nLooking forward to: well: who wouldn't do\nThe role I was about to play\n\nBut as if to knock me down\nReality came around\nAnd without so much as a mere touch\nCut me into little pieces\n\nLeaving me to doubt\nTalk about God in His mercy\nWho: if He really does exist\nWhy did He desert me?\n\nAnd in my hour of need\nI truly am: indeed\nAlone again: naturally\n\nIt seems to me that there are more hearts\nBroken in the world that can't be mended\nLeft unattended\nWhat do we do?\nWhat do we do?\n\nAlone again: naturally\n\nNow: looking back over the years\nAnd whatever else that appears\nI remember I cried when my father died\nNever wishing to hide the tears\n\nAnd at sixty-five years old\nMy mother: God rest her soul\nCouldn't understand why the only man\nShe had ever loved had been taken\n\nLeaving her to start\nWith a heart so badly broken\nDespite encouragement from me\nNo words were ever spoken\n\nAnd when she passed away\nI cried and cried all day\nAlone again: naturally \nAlone again: naturally",

I got a brand new pair of roller skates\nYou got a brand new key\n\nI ride my bike: I roller skate: don't drive no car\nDon't go too fast: but I go pretty far\nFor somebody who don't drive\nI been all around the world\nSome people say: I done all right for a girl\n\nWell: I got a brand new pair of roller skates\nYou got a brand new key\nI think that we should get together and try them out you see\nI been looking around awhile\nYou got something for me\nOh! I got a brand new pair of roller skates\nYou got a brand new key\n\nI asked your mother if you were at home\nShe said: yes ... but you weren't alone\nOh: sometimes I think that you're avoiding me\nI'm okay alone: but you've got something I need\n\nWell: I got a brand new pair of roller skates\nYou got a brand new key\nI think that we should get together and try them out to see\nLa la la la la la la la: la la la la la la\nOh! I got a brand new pair of roller skates\nYou got a brand new key",

        "Lyrics": "There's a port on a western bay\nAnd it serves a hundred ships a day\nLonely sailors pass the time away\nAnd talk about their homes\n\nAnd there's a girl in this harbor town\nAnd she works laying whiskey down\nThey say: \"Brandy: fetch another round\"\nShe serves them whiskey and wine\n\nThe sailors say: \"Brandy: you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nYeah: your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea\"\n\nBrandy wears a braided chain\nMade of finest silver from the north of Spain\nA locket that bears the name\nOf a man that Brandy loved\n\nHe came on a summer's day\nBringing gifts from far away\nBut he made it clear he couldn't stay\nNo harbor was his home\n\nThe sailor said: \"Brandy: you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nBut my life: my love and my lady is the sea\"\n\nYeah: Brandy used to watch his eyes\nWhen he told his sailor's story\nShe could feel the ocean fall and rise\nShe saw its raging glory\nBut he had always told the truth\nLord: he was an honest man\nAnd Brandy does her best to understand\n\nAt night when the bars close down\nBrandy walks through a silent town\nAnd loves a man who's not around\nShe still can hear him say\n\nShe hears him say: \"Brandy: you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nBut my life: my love and my lady is the sea\nIt is: yes: it is\"\n\n\"Brandy: you're a fine girl\n(You're a fine girl)\nWhat a good wife you would be\n(Such a fine girl)\nBut my life: my love and my lady is the sea\nIt is: it is: yes: it is\"",

Goode\nPlaying guitar like a-ringin' a bell\nAnd lookin' like he should\n\nIf you gotta play at Garden parties\nI wish you a lot of luck\nBut if memories were all I sang\nI rather drive a truck\n\nBut it's: all right now\nI learned my lesson well\nYou see ya can't please everyone\nSo ya got to please yourself\n\nLot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)\nLot-in-dah-dah-dah\n\nAnd it's: all right now (yeah)\nLearned my lesson well\nYou see: ya can't please everyone\nSo you got to please yourself",

        "Lyrics": "My pappy said: \"Son: you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'\nIf you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.\"\n\nHave you heard this story of the Hot Rod race\nWhen Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.\nThat story is true: I'm here to say\nI was drivin' that Model A.\n\nIt's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.\nThat Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.\nIt's got eight cylinders; uses them all.\nIt's got overdrive: just won't stall.\n\nWith a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust:\nWith 4.11 gears you can really get lost.\nIt's got safety tubes: but I ain't scared.\nThe brakes are good: tires fair.\n\nPulled out of San Pedro late one night\nThe moon and the stars was shinin' bright.\nWe was drivin' up Grapevine Hill\nPassing cars like they was standing still.\n\nAll of a sudden in a wink of an eye\nA Cadillac sedan passed us by.\nI said: \"Boys: that's a mark for me!\"\nBy then the taillight was all you could see.\n\nNow the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind:\nSo I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.\nTook my foot off the gas and man alive:\nI shoved it on down into overdrive.\n\nWound it up to a hundred-and-ten\nMy speedometer said that I hit top end.\nMy foot was blue: like lead to the floor.\nThat's all there is and there ain't no more.\n\nNow the boys all thought I'd lost my sense\nAnd telephone poles looked like a picket fence.\nThey said: \"Slow down! I see spots!\nThe lines on the road just look like dots.\"\n\nTook a corner; sideswiped a truck:\nCrossed my fingers just for luck.\nMy fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.\nThe guy beside me was white as a ghost.\n\nSmoke was comin' from out of the back\nWhen I started to gain on that Cadillac.\nKnew I could catch him: I thought I could pass.\nDon't you know by then we'd be low on gas?\n\nWe had flames comin' from out of the side.\nFeel the tension. Man! What a ride!\nI said: \"Look out: boys: I've got a license to fly!\"\nAnd that Caddy pulled over and let us by.\n\nNow all of a sudden she started to knockin':\nAnd down in the dips she started to rockin'.\nI looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'\nThe cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!\n\nThey arrested me and they put me in jail.\nAnd called my pappy to throw my bail.\nAnd he said: \"Son: you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'\nIf you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!\"",

Ain't nothing said\n\n'Cause Freddie's dead\nHey: hey\nLove: love\nHuh huh\nLove: love\nHey: hey\nHuh huh\nYeah: yeah\nFreddie's dead\n\nAll I want is some peace of mind\nWith a little love I'm trying to find\nThis could be such a beautiful world with a wonderful girl\nWhy I need a woman child: don't wanna be like Freddie now\n\n'Cause Freddie's dead\nEverybody's misused him: ripped him off and abused him\nAnother junkie playin': pushin' dope for the man\nFreddie's on the corner now: if you wanna be a junkie: wow\nRemember: Freddie's dead\n\nHuh huh\nHuh huh\nFreddie's dead",
