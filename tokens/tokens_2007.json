(nothing: no nothing)\nBaby: I won't shed a tear for you... (I won't shed a tear...)\nI won't lose a wink of sleep: 'cause the truth of the matter is \nReplacing you is so easy\n\nTo the left: to the left\nTo the left: to the left: mmm\nTo the left: to the left: everything you own in the box to the left\nTo the left: to the left\nDon't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable\n\nYou must not know 'bout me\nYou must not know 'bout me\nI could have another you in a minute\nMatter of fact: he'll be here in a minute: baby\n\nYou must not know 'bout me\nYou must not know 'bout me\nI can have another you by tomorrow\nSo don't you ever for a second get to thinkin': baby: hey hey\n\nYou must not know 'bout me\nYou must not know 'bout me\n'Cause I could have another you in a minute\nMatter of fact: he'll be here in a minute: baby\n\nYou must not know 'bout me: nigga: pack all yo' bags: we finished\nYou must not know 'bout me: 'cause you made your bed: now lay in it\nI can have another you by tomorrow\nSo don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable",

Is it going?\nI don't know\nWhat you're lookin' for\nOh yeah: boss\nCome on\n\nI'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye-eye\nI'm real as it comes: if you don't know why I'm fly\nI seen you try to switch it up: but girl you ain't that dope\nI'm the Wonder Woman: let me go get my rope\n\nI'm a supermodel and mommy: s&#xED; mommy\nAmnesty International got Bangkok to Montauk on lock\nLove my ass and my abs in the video called \"Promiscuous\"\nMy style is ri-dic-dic-dic-ulous -ulous -ulous\n\nIf you see us in the club: we'll be acting real nice\nIf you see us on the floor: you'll be watchin' all night\n\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\nWanna see you work your body\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\n\nWhen Timbo is in the party: everybody put up they hands\nI get a half a mil' for my beats: you get a couple gra-a-and\nNever gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand\nI'm respected from Californ.I.A. way down to Japan\n\nI'm a real producer and you just a piano man\nYour songs don't top the charts: I heard 'em: I'm not a fa-a-an\nNiggas talkin' greasy: I'm the one that gave them they chance\nSomebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can\n\nIf you see us in the club: we'll be acting real nice\nIf you see us on the floor: you'll be watchin' all night\n\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\nWanna see you work your body\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\n\nCould you speak up and stop mu-mumbling. I don't think you came in clear\nWhen you're sittin' on the top: it's hard to hear you from way up here\nNow: I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV: \"Just let me clear the air...\"\nWe missed you on the charts last week: damn: that's right: you wasn't there\n\nIf se-sexy never left: then why's everybody on my shit-it-it?\nDon't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it\nSo if you see us in the club: go on and walk the other way\n'Cause our run will never be over: not at least until we say\n\nIf you see us in the club: we'll be acting real nice\nIf you see us on the floor: you'll be watchin' all night\n\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\nWanna see you work your body\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\n\nIf you see us in the club: we'll be acting real nice\nIf you see us on the floor: you'll be watchin' all night\n\nWe ain't here to hurt nobody\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me\nWanna see you work your body\nSo give it to me: give it to me: give it to me",

I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nLet him know that you know best\n'Cause after all you do know best\nTry to slip past his defense\nWithout granting innocence\n\nLay down a list of what is wrong\nThe things you've told him all along\nAnd pray to God he hears you\nAnd pray to God he hears you\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr brake with the ones you've followed\n\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life",

(Flossy)\nAnd we in the street life until they call the law (Ballin'!)\nI made the whip get naked (What happened?)\nWhile I switch gears: bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got em)\nStep out: show me what you all about\nFlashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)\n1 a.m.: we was at the club (What happened?)\n2 a.m.: 10 bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)\nAnd about 3-something I was thinking about grub\nSo I stumbled to the car: threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)\n\nWe fly high: no lie: you know this (Ballin'!)\nForeign rides: outside: it's like showbiz (We in the building)\nWe stay fly: No Lie: you know this (Ballin'!)\nHips and thighs: oh my: stay focused\n\nNigga: could you buy that?\nI keep 20 in the pocket (Light Change)\nTalk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)\nBut of course gotta fly ...? (Where?)\nTo the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb\nBut I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get Your Money Up)\nDrive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got an urge (Speeding)\nThe rap game like the crack game\nLifestyles: rich and famous living in the fast lane (Ballin'!)\nSo when I bleep: shorty bleep back\nLou' Vuitton belt where I'mma keep all the heat strapped\nI beat the trial over Rucker (Let's do it!)\nAll guns loaded and I'm back: motherfucker (Dipset)\n\nWe fly high: no lie: you know this (Ballin'!)\nForeign rides: outside: it's like showbiz (We in the building)\nWe stay fly: No Lie: you know this (Ballin'!)\nHips and thighs: oh my: stay focused\n\nYou niggas need to stay focus\nWhen you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G\nYou know my name: Jones: One Eye: Capo Status\nOnly above motherfucka\nThis Dipset ByrdGang We Born To Fly\nY'all know the rules fall back or fall back\nSomeone tell my bitch Summer I'm lookin' for her\nYa dig: another day another dollar\nFast life fucker",

Uh-Huh...\nEverybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)\n200 bitches and I'm bettin' ain't none of them hot (ain't none of them hot)\n'Cept for this pretty young thang that was workin' all the way at the top (all the way at the top)\nShawty what is your name?\n\nOoh she made us drinks: to drink\nWe drunk 'em: Got drunk\nAnd then I think she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink: I winked back\nAnd then I think that: we hit it off something proper like...\n\nI like the bartender\n(Ooh If you're lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her\n(Uh-huh: Ok)\nI like the bartender\n(Yeah if you're lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her\n(Ooh Uh-huh: Ok)\n\nGot a brand new girl so I'm feeling all good inside (all good inside)\nFeel like I put some brand new 24's on a brand new ride (on a brand new ride)\nTriple shot of patron on the rocks with little bit a lime (with a little bit a lime)\nI'm just keeping it real (Uh-huh)\nBaby still working at the club so I'm getting in free (so I'm getting in free)\nWednesday night I'm on the list T-Pain plus 3 (T-Pain plus 3)\nEverytime I hit the spot baby girl taking care of me (taking care of me)\nHow do you think I feel?\n\nOoh she made us drinks: to drink\nWe drunk 'em: Got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink: I winked back\nAnd then I think that: we gonna have fun at my spot tonight...\n\nI like the bartender\n(Ooh If you're lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her\n(Uh-huh: Ok)\nI like the bartender\n(Yeah if you're lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her\n(Ooh Uh-huh: Ok)\n\nAkon\nShorty I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (ever come out)\nUnless I'm in the M6 doing tricks freeway burnt out (freeway burnt out)\nGot a passenger side that's empty wanting it to be your spot (be your spot)\nPut you on my billboard we can act like the charts I can end up on top (end up on top)\nDon't smoke don't drink that's why I don't be by the bar baby (baby)\nJust lookin' at you from a distance looking like a goddamn star baby (baby)\nSo my girl don't see me T-Pain can I get those keys to the car? (those keys to the car?)\n'Bout to go and Bang Bang Boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomar' (see you tomar')\n\nT-Pain and Akon\nOoh she made us drinks: to drink\nWe drunk 'em: Got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink: I winked back (Uh-huh)\nAnd then I think that: (Uh-huh) we 'gon have fun at my spot tonight... (Oh yes)\n\nT-Pain\nI like the bartender\n(Ooh If you're lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her\n(Uh-huh: Ok)\nI like the bartender\n(Yeah if you're lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her\n(Ooh Uh-huh: Ok)",

        "Lyrics": "This is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\n\nSix months later now we're big dog status.\nName elevated but I still act average.\nRockin' shows in Dallas: ball like I play for the Mavericks.\nWest Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest.\nFrench Rivera spot and I'm getting in shape man.\nI think I'm Super M-A-N without a cape man.\nRidin' all day hustlin'; all for the cake man.\nI'm a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes.\nFirst they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon.\nI'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans\nI'm a steal every girl ever gonna to fly.\nI'm a young little dude: stay runnin' from cops.\nEmerald Row is the place where I got my props.\nPeople love me in da hood they don't want me to stop.\nSo uh: that's the only way I know how to rock.\nAnd I'm a stay rap plus I ain't goin' stop till I drop.\n\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\n\nI I's Baby Boy and I done it again.\nI'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in 'cedes Benz\nTwenty two wanna ride with the ladies then\nRed Bull: Grey Goose: now the ladies bent\nNow we go and do a thing under a shady tent\nAnd they don't question what I say 'cause I'm a ladies pimp.\nSee this little one right here this fellow got stripes.\nAnd I is represent: my rail room for life.\nMoney in my pocket but I still act trife\nWhile I in da club they say the parlor a'int right.\nLook I'm-doing great that's the way I feel.\nHustlin' hard all day that's the way I live.\n\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\n\nThis the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside.\nRed pepper paint must believe my ish ride.\nThey pause like stop signs when they rollin' up.\nCause' when the doors open up: they open UP.\nI'm Lamboin' it I was stashed: off stage I'm throwin' it.\n'Cause they say I'm like Katrina with money: I blow the shhhh.\nReal been gravy: three years out of da eighties.\nSolos: shabo's valley animals played it.\nCommodores mirages: not the Nike hirages.\nIt cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this.\nY'all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine.\nDon't give me viesels y'all thinkin' this McDonalds size.\nI been fly I I I I I I I I from the crib to the ri I I I I I de\nFifty-Four inch screens 26 inches from the ceiling dude.\nThe plasma look like a projector up in da livin' room homie!\n\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.\nLil' Boy still pushin' big wheels\nI stack my money: lay low: and chill.\nNo need to work hard that's the way I feel: I feel: I\nThis is the way I live.",

Dub E.N.T.\nShe have nice size with them pretty brown bright eyes\nI'm a win it with the right prize & I'm gonna give it to her\nTo the rhythm of a high hat: she got a beautiful mind you can't buy that\nAnd the sight from behind when she walk on by\nMake a nigga wanna try that\nShe got the prettiest smile and she gangsta\nKeep me from runnin' wild & I thank her\nAnd we can talk about anything she got good conversation\nMy homey little friend and plus she patient.\n\nOnly thing that keeps me up\nWhen I'm feelin' down\nI don't know about you\nBut I gotta keep mines around\n'Cause I done looked I done searched\nAnd it's hard to find\nAnother Shorty Like Mine\nBaby yes I'm\nAddicted to how we kick it\nEverything you say to me\nNever knew it could be so wicked\nHopin' that you stay with me\nYou search around the world\nBut you never find\nAnother Shorty Like Mine: Shorty Like Mine.\n\nI tell my niggas that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine\nCute face nice size like mine...",

        "Lyrics": "Your subtleties they strangle me \nI can't explain myself at all \nAnd all the wants: and all the needs\nAll I don't want to need at all \n\nThe walls start breathing: my mind's unweaving\nMaybe it's best you leave me alone\nA weight is lifted on this evening \nI give the final blow\n\nWhen darkness turns to light\nIt ends tonight: it ends tonight\n\nA falling star: at least I fall alone \nI can't explain what you can't explain \nYou're finding things that you didn't know\nI look at you with such disdain\n\nThe walls start breathing: my mind's unweaving \nMaybe it's best you leave me alone \nA weight is lifted on this evening \nI give the final blow \n\nWhen darkness turns to light \nIt ends tonight: it ends tonight \nJust a little insight won't make this right \nIt's too late to fight: it ends tonight: it ends tonight\n\nNow I'm on my own side \nIt's better than being on your side \nIt's my fault when you're blind \nIt's better that I see it through your eyes \n\nAll these thoughts locked inside \nNow you're the first to know \n\nWhen darkness turns to light \nIt ends tonight: it ends tonight\n\nJust a little insight won't make this right \nIt's too late to fight: it ends tonight\nIt ends when darkness turns to light \nIt ends tonight: it ends tonight\n\nJust a little insight won't make this right \nIt's too late to fight: it ends tonight: it ends tonight\nTonight: insight \nWhen darkness turns to light it ends tonight",

And uh:\nI just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and\nIt's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and\nLord: would you help me? And stop this pain\nI keep inflinctin on my family (family)\nHustlin and gamblin: drinkin' and scramblin'\nAnd losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'\nIt's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man\nAnd I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin' not to panic\n\nI try so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan I try so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault 'cause I...\nTried to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHoping one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then: I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow\nBut until then...\nI'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough\n\nI see thangs won't change\nI'm stuck in the game\nAs soon as I get out it\nKeeps pullin me back mayne\nGot me doin' dirty dirt\nSo used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work\nStudied on the streets: hustlers know what I mean\nHustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league\nSo we never leave never: till the sun came up\nGotta get it nope no leavin' no rush\nToday games they play gotta go hard to get what you put in\nIf you fall off then it's all on you\nGotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool\n\nI try so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan I try so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault 'cause i...\nTried to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHopin one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then: I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow\nBut until then...\nI'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough",

Try to make it all okay\n\nDoes it hurt to know I'll never be there?\nBet it sucks to see my face everywhere\nIt was you who chose to end it like you did\nI was the last to know\nYou knew exactly what you would do\nDon't say you simply lost your way\nShe may believe you: but I never will\nNever again\n\nIf she really knows the truth: she deserves you\nA trophy wife: oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss\nBut when your day comes: and he's through with you\nAnd he'll be through with you: you'll die together but alone\n\nYou wrote me in a letter: you couldn't say it right to my face\nGive me that Sunday school answer: repent yourself away\n\nDoes it hurt to know I'll never be there?\nBet it sucks to see my face everywhere\nIt was you who chose to end it like you did\nI was the last to know\nYou knew exactly what you would do\nDon't say you simply lost your way\nThey may believe you: but I never will\nNever again\n\nNever again will I hear you\nNever again will I miss you\nNever again will I fall to you\nNever\nNever again will I kiss you\nNever again will I want to\nNever again will I love you\nNever\n\nDoes it hurt to know I'll never be there?\nBet it sucks to see my face everywhere\nIt was you who chose to end it like you did\nI was the last to know\nYou knew exactly what you would do\nDon't say you simply lost your way\nThey may believe you: but I never will\nI never will\nI never will\nNever again",

Uh: uh: uh.\nWind it up! Uh: uh: uh.\n\nCome on.\n\nWind it up! Uh: uh: uh.\nOdl lay odl lay odl-ooh.\n\nYou've got to let the beat get under your skin\nYou've got to open up and let it all in\nBut see: once it gets in: the popping begins\nThen you find out why all the boys stare.\n\nSee: they're trying to bite our style\nTrying to study our approach\nThey like the way we do it: so original\nI guess that they are slow: so they should leave the room\nThis beat is for the clubs and cars that go...\n\nEvery time the bass bang\nRealize it calls your name\nLet the beat wind you up\nAnd don't stop till your time is up.\nGet in line now.\n\nWind it up! Uh: uh: uh.\n\nAre you all ready?\n\nWind it up! Uh: uh: uh.\nWind it up! Uh: uh: uh.\nWind it up!\nOdl lay odl lay odl-ooh.\n\nUh huh: it's your moment\nUh huh: come on girl: you know you own it\nUh huh: you know your key is still tick-tockin'\nHell yeah: but you know they're watchin'.\n\nGet it girl: get it: get it girl\nGet it girl: get it: get it girl\nTo the front: to the side\nTo the back: but don't let him ride\n\nKeep goin' girl: it's your night\nDon't let him steal your light\nI know he thinks you're fine and stuff.\nBut does he know how to wind you up?\n\nCome on.\n\nWind it up!

You got me saying\n\nAYO\nI'm tired of using technology\nWhy don't you sit down on top of me\nAYO\nI'm tired of using technology\nI need you right in front of me\n\nOoh: she wants it: uh uh: she wants it\nOoh: she wants it: so I got to give it to her\nOoh: she wants it: uh uh: she wants it\nOoh: she wants it: so I got to give it to her\n\nTimbaland\nYour hips: your thighs: you got me hypnotized: let me tell you\nYour hips: your thighs: you got me hypnotized: let me tell you\nYour hips: your thighs: you got me hypnotized: let me tell you\nYour hips: your thighs: you got me hypnotized: let me tell you\n\n50 Cent\nGot a thing for that thing she got\nThe way she make it tick: the way she make it pop\nMake it rain for her so she don't stop\nI ain't got to move: I can sit and watch\nIn her fantasy: it's plain to see\nJust how it be: on me: backstrokin': sweat soaking\nAll into my set sheets\nWhen she ready to ride: I'm ready to roll\nI'll be in this bitch till the club close\nWatchin' her do her thing on all fours\nNow that that there should be against the law\nFrom side to side: let the ride break it down-down-down\nYou know I like when you hike and you throw it all around\nDifferent style: different move: damn I like the way you move\nGirl: you got me thinking 'bout all the things I do to you\nLet's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions\nFrom the couch to the counters in my kitchen\n\nJustin Timberlake\nLemme talk to ya\nBaby: this a new age: you like my new craze\nLet's get together - maybe we can start a new phase\nThe smokes got the club all hazy: spotlights don't do you justice baby\nWhy don't you come over here?

        "Lyrics": "Come to decide that the things that I tried\nWere in my life just to get high on\nWhen I sit alone: come get a little known\nBut I need more than myself this time\n\nStep from the road to the sea to the sky\nAnd I do believe that we rely on\nWhen I lay it on: come get to play it on\nAll my life to sacrifice\n\nHey oh\nListen what I say oh\nI got your hey oh\nNow listen what I say oh: oh\n\nWhen will I know that I really can't go\nTo the well once more: time to decide on\nWhen it's killing me: when will I really see\nAll that I need to look inside\n\nCome to believe that I better not leave\nBefore I get my chance to ride\nWhen it's killing me: what do I really need\nAll that I need to look inside\n\nHey oh\nListen what I say oh\nCome back and hey oh\nLook at what I say oh\n\nThe more I see: the less I know\nThe more I like to let it go\nHey oh: woah\n\nDeep beneath the cover\nOf another perfect wonder\nWhere it's so white as snow\n\nPrivately divided\nBy a world so undecided\nAnd there's nowhere to go\n\nIn between the cover\nOf another perfect wonder\nAnd it's so white as snow\n\nRunning through the field\nWhere all my tracks will be concealed\nAnd there's nowhere to go\n\nWhen to descend: to amend for a friend\nAll the channels that have broken down\nNow you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up\nJust to hear you sing it out\n\nStep from the road to the sea to the sky\nAnd I do believe what we rely on\nWhen I lay it on: come get to play it on\nAll my life to sacrifice\n\nHey oh\nListen what I say oh\nI got your hey oh\nListen what I say oh\n\nThe more I see the less I know\nThe more I like to let it go\nHey oh: woah\n\nDeep beneath the cover\nOf another perfect wonder\nWhere it's so white as snow\n\nPrivately divided\nBy a world so undecided\nAnd there's nowhere to go\n\nIn between the cover\nOf another perfect wonder\nWhere it's so white as snow\n\nRunning through the field\nWhere all my tracks will be concealed\nAnd there's nowhere to go\n\nI said hey: hey: yeah\nOh yeah: tell my love now\nHey: hey: yeah\nOh yeah: tell my love now\n\nDeep beneath the cover\nOf another perfect wonder\nWhere it's so white as snow\n\nPrivately divided\nBy a world so undecided\nAnd there's nowhere to go\n\nDeep beneath the cover\nOf another perfect wonder\nWhere it's so white as snow\n\nRunning through the field\nWhere all my tracks will be concealed\nAnd there's nowhere to go\n\nI said hey: oh yeah\nOh yeah: tell my love now\nHey: yeah: yeah: oh yeah",

        "Lyrics": "I think you can do much better than me\nAfter all the lies that I made you believe\nGuilt kicks in and I start to see\nThe edge of the bed\nWhere your nightgown used to be\nI told myself I won't miss you\nBut I remembered\nWhat it feels like beside you\n\nI really miss your hair in my face\nAnd the way your innocence tastes\nAnd I think you should know this\nYou deserve much better than me\n\nWhile looking through your old box of notes\nI found those pictures I took\nThat you were looking for\nIf there's one memory I don't want to lose\nThat time at the mall\nYou and me in the dressing room\nI told myself I won't miss you\nBut I remembered\nWhat it feels like beside you\n\nI really miss your hair in my face\nAnd the way your innocence tastes\nAnd I think you should know this\nYou deserve much better than me\n\nThe bed I'm lying in is getting colder\nWish I never would've said it's over\nAnd I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older\n'Cause we never really had our closure\nThis can't be the end\n\nI really miss your hair in my face\nAnd the way your innocence tastes\nAnd I think you should know this\nYou deserve much better than me\n\nI really miss your hair in my face\nAnd the way your innocence tastes\nAnd I think you should know this\nYou deserve much better than me\n(And I think you should know this)\n(You deserve much better than me)",
