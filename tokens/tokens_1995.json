        "Lyrics": "A lonely mother gazing out of her window\nStaring at a son that she just can't touch\nIf at any time he's in a jam: she'll be by his side\nBut he doesn't realize he hurts her so much\n\nBut all the praying just ain't helping at all\n'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble\nSo he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how\nAnother body laying cold in the gutter\nListen to me\n\nDon't go chasin' waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\n\nLittle Precious has a natural obsession\nFor temptation but he just can't see\nShe gives him loving that his body can't handle\nBut all he can say is: \"Baby it's good to me.\"\n\nOne day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror\nBut he doesn't recognize his own face\nHis health is fading and he doesn't know why\nThree letters took him to his final resting place\nYa'll don't hear me\n\nDon't go chasin' waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\n\nDon't go chasin' waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\n\nCome on\nI seen a rainbow yesterday\nBut too many storms have come and gone\nLeavin' a trace of not one God given ray\nIs it because my life is ten shades of gray\nI pray all ten fade away\nSeldom praise Him for the sunny days\n\nAnd like his promise is true\nOnly my faith can undo\nThe many chances I blew\nTo bring my life to anew\nClear blue and unconditional skies\nHave dried the tears from my eyes\nNo more lonely cries\n\nMy only bleedin' hope\nIs for the folk who can't cope\nWit such an endurin' pain\nThat it keeps em' in the pourin' rain\nWho's to blame\nFor tootin' caine into your own vein\nWhat a shame\nYou shoot and aim for someone else's brain\n\nYou claim the insane\nAnd name this day and time\nFor fallin' prey to crime\nI say the system got you victim to your own mind\nDreams are hopeless aspirations\nIn hopes of comin' true\nBelieve in yourself\nThe rest is up to me and you\n\nDon't go chasin' waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\n\nDon't go chasin' waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast",

        "Lyrics": "This Romeo is bleeding\nBut you can't see his blood\nIt's nothing but some feelings\nThat this old dog kicked up\n\nIt's been raining since you left me\nNow I'm drowning in the flood\nYou see: I've always been a fighter\nBut without you: I give up\n\nI can't sing a love song\nLike the way it's meant to be\nWell: I guess I'm not that good anymore\nBut baby: that's just me\n\nAnd I will love you: baby: always\nAnd I'll be there forever and a day: always\nI'll be there 'til the stars don't shine\n'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme\nAnd I know when I die: you'll be on my mind\nAnd I'll love you: always\n\nNow your pictures that you left behind\nAre just memories of a different life\nSome that made us laugh: some that made us cry\nOne that made you have to say goodbye\nWhat I'd give to run my fingers through your hair\nTo touch your lips: to hold you near\nWhen you say your prayers: try to understand\nI've made mistakes: I'm just a man\n\nWhen he holds you close: when he pulls you near\nWhen he says the words you've been needing to hear\nI wish I was him\nWith these words of mine\nTo say to you 'til the end of time\n\nThat I will love you baby: always\nAnd I'll be there forever and a day: always\n\nIf you told me to cry for you: I could\nIf you told me to die for you: I would\nTake a look at my face\nThere's no price I won't pay\nTo say these words to you\n\nWell: there ain't no luck\nIn these loaded dice\nBut baby if you give me just one more try\nWe can pack up our old dreams\nAnd our old lives\nWe'll find a place where the sun still shines\n\nAnd I will love you: baby: always\nAnd I'll be there forever and a day: always\nI'll be there 'til the stars don't shine\n'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme\nI know when I die: you'll be on my mind\nAnd I'll love you: always\n\nAlways: always",

I-d-e-s\nNever the less I'm hella fresh rollin' joints like a cigarette\nSo pass it 'cross the table like Ping Pong\nI'm gone: beatin' my chest like King Kong\nIt's on: wrap my lips around a 40\nAnd when it comes to get another stogie: fools all kick in like Shinobi\nNo: me ain't no homie to begin with\nIt's too many heads to be poppin' it at my friend hit-bit\nUnless you pull out the phat crispy\nFive dollar bill on the real: before it's history\nCause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs\nAn if you let 'em hit it for free You hella \"dum-du-dum-dum\"\nI come to school with the taylor on my earlobe\nAvoidin' all the thick teasers: skeezers and weirdos\nThat be blowin' off the land like \"Where tha bomb at?\"\nGive me two bucks: you take a puff and pass my bomb back\nSuck up the dank like a slurpy: the serious\nBomb will make a nigga go delirious\nLike Eddie Murphy. I got more growin' pains than Maggie\nCause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie\n\nI got five on it: got it good\nGrab your 4-0: let's get keyed\nI got five on it\nMessin' wit that Indo weed\nI got five on it *got it good*\nIt's got me stuck and not go back\nI got five on it\nPotna: let's go half on a sac\n\n\nI take sacks to the face whenever I can\nDon't need no crutch: I'm so keyed up so the joint be burnin' my hand\nNext time I roll it in a hampa\nTo burn slow so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand: bra\nHoochies can hit: but they know they got to pitch in\nThen I roll a joint that's longer than your extension\n'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free\nHell no: you better bring your own spliff: chief\nWhat's up: don't babysit that: better pass the\nJoint: stop hittin': cause you know you got Asthma\nCrack the 40 open: homie\nAnd guzzle it: 'cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely\nI gotta take a whiz test to my P-O\nI know I failed: 'cause I done smoked major weed: bro\nAnd every time we with Chris that fool rollin' up a fattie\nBut the Tanqueray straight had me\n\nI got five on it *got it good*\nGrab your 4-0: let's get keyed\nI got five on it\nMessin' wit that Indo weed\nI got five on it *got it good*\nIt's got me stuck and not go back\nI got five on it *got it good*\nPotna: let's go half on a sac\n\n\nAy: make this right: man: stop at the light: man\nMy yesternight thang got me hung off the night train\nYou fade: I face: so let's head to da east\nHit the stroll to 9-0: so we can roll big hashish\nI wish I could fade the eighth: but I'm low budget\nStill rollin' a two door Cutlass: same ole' bucket\nFoggy windows: soggy Indo\nI'm in the land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk\n\n\nBeen smoked - Yuk'll spray ya: lay ya down\nUp in the OAK the Town: homies don't play around: we down to blaze a pound\nThen ease up: speed up through the ESO Drink the VSOP up\nWith a lemon squeezer\nAnd everybody's rolled up: I'm da roller\nThat's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky dosia\nHold up: suck up my weed is all you do\nKick in feed: 'cause where I be's we need tab like a foo-foo\n\nI got five on it *got it good*\nGrab your 4-0: let's get keyed\nI got five on it\nMessin' wit that Indo weed\nI got five on it *got it good*\nIt's got me stuck and not go back\nI got five on it *got it good*\nPotna: let's go half on a sac",

Hold on to me\nHold on: everything's gonna be all right. Just hold on to me tonight\n\nAnything that hurts you hurts me too\nI'm not gonna let your world turn blue\nWill you take my hand and feel how close I am\nThere ain't nothin' I won't do for you\n\nI know the world can drive you to your knees: but when you need to cry\nBaby: cry to me",

I never understood: black\nWhy the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats\nI tell 'em scat: skittle: scabobble\nGot hit with a bottle and I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess\nI confess it's a shame\nWhen you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name\nGlad I came to my senses\nLike quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach overcommeth\nBy the thoughts of me and her together: right?\nSo when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type\n\nI wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:\nI wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a 64' Impala\n\nI wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:\nI wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a 64' Impala\n\nI wish I had a brand-new car: so far I got this hatchback\nAnd everywhere I go: yo I gets laughed at\nAnd when I'm in my car: I'm laid back\nI got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat: but that's flat\nAnd do you really wanna know what's really whack\nSee I can't even get a date: so what do you think of that?\nI heard that prom night is a bomb night with the hood rats you can hold tight: but really tho'\nI 'm a figaro when I'm in my car I can't even get a hello\nWell so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday\nWell then I'ma have to get in my car and go\nYou know I take the 110 until the 105\nGet off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive\n'Cause it's hard to survive\nWhen your livin' in a concrete jungle and These girls just keep passin' me by\nShe looks fly: she looks fly\nMakes me say my: my: my\n\nI wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:\nI wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a 64' Impala\n\nI wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:\nI wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a 64' Impala\n\nI wish I was little bit taller\nI wish I was little bit taller:\nI wish I was a baller:\nI wish I was a baller:\nI wish I was little bit taller: y'all\nI wish I was little bit taller: y'all\nI wish I was a baller:\nI wish I was a baller:\nI wish I was little bit taller: y'all\nI wish I was little bit taller: y'all\nI wish I was a baller:\nI wish I was a baller:\nI wish I was little bit taller: y'all\nI wish I was little bit taller: y'all\nI wish I was a baller: yeah\n\nHey: I wish I had my way 'cause everyday would be a Friday\nYou could even speed on the highway\nI would play ghetto games: name my kids ghetto names\nLittle Mookie: Big Al: Lorraine\nYo you know that's on the real\nSo if you're down on your luck then you should notice how I feel\n'Cause if you don't want me around\nSee I go simple: I go easy: I go greyhound\nHey: you: what's that sound?\nEverybody look what's going down\nAh: yes: ain't that fresh?\nEverybody wants to get down like dat\n\nI wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:\nI wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a 64' Impala\n\nI wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:\nI wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her\nI wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat\nAnd a 64' Impala\n\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish\nI wish",

        "Lyrics": "Well I've walked these streets\nA virtual stage it seemed to me\nMakeup on their faces\nActors took their places next to me\n\nWell I've walked these streets\nIn a carnival of sights to see\nAll the cheap thrill seekers\nThe vendors and the dealers they crowded around me\n\nHave I been blind\nHave I been lost inside myself and my own mind\nHypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen\n\nWell I've walked these streets\nIn a spectacle of wealth and poverty\nIn the diamond market\nThe scarlet welcome carpet that they just rolled out for me\n\nAnd I've walked these streets\nIn the madhouse asylum they can be\nWhere a wild eyed misfit prophet on a traffic island stopped\nAnd he raved of saving me\n\nHave I been blind\nHave I been lost inside myself and my own mind\nHypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen\n\nHave I been wrong\nHave I been wise to shut my eyes and play along\nHypnotized paralyzed by what my eyes have found\nBy what my eyes have seen\nWhat they have seen\n\nHave I been blind\nHave I been lost have I been wrong\nHave I been wise have I been strong\nHave I been hypnotized mesmerized\nBy what my eyes have found\n\nIn that great street carnival\nIn that carnival",

Sugar hill: baby. Ay yo: son: pull the shades down and let's count this money. Put the Grant's in the safe 'cause we spending the Jackson's. The Washington's go to wifey: ya know how we do.)\n\nNo more cutting grams: and wrapping grands up in rubberbands: I'm a recovered man\nOur plans ta discover other lands\nSuburban places got me seeking for oasis\nCrystal by the cases: ladies of all races with dime faces\nSex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas\nThough this ain't promised: I'm as determined as them old timers\nI wanna villa in a Costa Rica\nSo I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta treat ya\nLaid in the shades of the Everglades: finally forever paid\nWearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made\nMe and my team: Caribbean's foreseen\nI guess being down for so long I'm all in store ta see my dreams\n\nSo until I see past the green pasture\nMe being supreme master: ain't much more life ta feind after\nBut another chapter: a new way of life to adapt ta\n'Cause these streets a gas ya: and have ya caught up in the rapture\nDeja vu: I could vision my killa crew: more hospitable\nConsciously aware plus political\n'Cause though they claim that every man created equal\nWhat's his native people: find it harder for nights to sleep through:\nBut once established we eating lovely: living lavish\nLike the house of Versi: Paris: I gotta have it\nIt's so plus: just ta visualize is like a coke rush\nVivid enough: ta make living this a must: plus this is real\n\n(Chorus and ad-libs until end)",

        "Lyrics": "Hah\n\nThere's a time and place for everything: for everyone\nWe can push with all our might: but nothin's gonna come\nOh no: nothing's gonna change\nAnd if I asked you not to try: oh: could you let be?\n\nI wanna hold you and say\nWe can't throw this all away\nTell me you won't go: you won't go\nDo you have to hear me say?\n\nI can't stop lovin' you\nAnd no matter what I say or do\nYou know my heart is true: oh\nI can't stop lovin' you\n\nYou change your friends: your place in life: you can change your mind\nWe can change the way we say and do anytime\nOh no: but I think you'll find\nThat when you look inside your heart: oh baby: I'll be there: yeah\n\nHold on\nI'm holding on\nBaby: just come on: come on: come on\nI just wanna hear you say\n\nI can't stop lovin' you\nAnd no matter what you say or do\nYou know my heart is true: oh\nI can't stop lovin' you\n\nOh: I'm so twisted and tied\nAnd all I remember\nWas how hard we tried\nOnly to surrender\n\nAnd when it's over\nI know how it's gonna be\nAnd true love will never die\nOh: not fade away\n\nAnd I can't stop lovin' you\nNo matter what I say or do\nYou know my heart is true: oh\nI can't stop lovin' you\n\nAnd I know what I got to do\nHey Ray: what you said is true: oh\nI can't stop lovin' you: oh\nOh: I can't stop lovin' you",
