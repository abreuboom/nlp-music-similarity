Can you sit for a while?\"\nHe shook his head and he said with a smile\n\"What I'd really like: Dad: is to borrow the car keys\nSee you later. Can I have them please?\"\n\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man in the moon\n\"When you coming home: son?\" \"I don't know when\nBut we'll get together then: Dad\nYou know we'll have a good time then\"\n\nI've long since retired:my son's moved away\nI called him up just the other day\nI said: \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind\"\nHe said: \"I'd love to: Dad: if I could find the time\nYou see: my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu\nBut it's sure nice talking to you: Dad\nIt's been sure nice talking to you\"\nAnd as I hung up the phone: it occurred to me\nHe'd grown up just like me\nMy boy was just like me\n\nAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon\nLittle boy blue and the man in the moon\n\"When you coming home: son?\" \"I don't know when\nBut we'll get together then: Dad\nWe're gonna have a good time then\"",

Swearin' to God\nYou made me see so I believed in me\nOh you've been fillin' my cup\nTill I'm runnin' over with joy\nFrom you heaven sent love\nJust touch me again\nI'm king of all men... and reigning from above\n\nSwearin' to God (Swearin' to God)\nYour mistress of the world and all I am\n(Don't tell the angels)\nSwearin' to God (Swearin' to God)\nYour where I won in paradise... began\nNo one gets me up there like you can\nBut girl you know I'm only human\nAnd I'm swearin' to god (Swearin' to God)\nSo glad you've givin' me: you\n\n(I was known for you: baby)\nGirl ain't you glad we made it\n(Made to give my heart and soul to you: baby)\nI'm so very glad you gave it\n(Hey baby were together)\nTry livin' on forever as long\nAs long as we live (as we live)\n\nSwearin' to god (Swearin' to God)\nWhy dedicate my life to loving you\n(Don't tell the angels)\nI'm swearin' to god (Swearin' to God)\nI cross my heart and hope to die... I do\nJust call me your one woman lover\nI can't even look at another\nI'm swearin' to god (swearin' to god)\nSo glad I'm livin'\nI'm swearin' to god (Swearin' to God)\nFor all he's givin' me\nSwearin' to god (Swearin' to God)\nSo glad he's givin' me you\nWhoa: swearin' to god (Swearin' to God)\nLook what he's givin' me (Swearin' to God)\nMore than the world can see (Swearin' to God)\nHe's givin' me you... oh\n(I love you)",
