        "Lyrics": "Where is the moment when we needed the most?\nYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lost\nTell me your blue skies fade to grey\nTell me your passion's gone away\nAnd I don't need no carrying on\n\nYou're standing in line just to hit a new low\nYou're faking a smile with a coffee to go\nTell me your life's been way off line\nYou're falling to pieces every time\nAnd I don't need no carrying on\n\n'Cause you had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song \nJust to turn it around\n\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work on a smile \nAnd you go for a ride\n\nYou had a bad day\nThe camera don't lie\nYou're coming back down \nAnd you really don't mind\nYou had a bad day\nYou had a bad day\n\nWell: you need a blue sky holiday\nThe point is they laugh at what you say\nAnd I don't need no carrying on\n\nYou had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song \nJust to turn it around\n\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work on a smile \nAnd you go for a ride\n\nYou had a bad day\nThe camera don't lie\nYou're coming back down\nAnd you really don't mind\nYou had a bad day\nOh: a holiday\n\nSometimes the system goes on the blink\nAnd the whole thing turns out wrong\nYou might not make it back and you know\nThat you could be well oh that strong\nAnd I'm not wrong: yeah\n\nSo where is the passion when you need it the most?\nOh: you and I\nYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lost\n\n'Cause you had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song\nJust to turn it around\n\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work on a smile\nAnd you go for a ride\n\nYou had a bad day\nYou've seen what you like\nAnd how does it feel for one more time\nYou had a bad day\nYou had a bad day\n\n(A holiday)\nYou had a bad day\n(A holiday)\nYou had a bad day\n(A holiday)\nYou had a bad day",

I don't see no ring on your hand\nI be the first to admit it\nI'm curious about you: you seem so innocent\n\nYou wanna get in my world: get lost in it\nBoy I'm tired of running: let's walk for a minute\n\nPromiscuous girl\nWherever you are\nI'm all alone\nAnd it's you that I want\n\nPromiscuous boy\nYou already know\nThat I'm all yours\nWhat you waiting for?\n\nPromiscuous girl\nYou're teasing me\nYou know what I want\nAnd I got what you need\n\nPromiscuous boy\nLet's get to the point\n'Cause we're on a roll\nAre you ready?\n\nRoses are red: some diamonds are blue\nChivalry is dead: but you're still kind of cute\n\nHey: I can't keep my mind off you\nWhere you at: do you mind if I come through?\n\nI'm out of this world: come with me to my planet\nGet you on my level do you think that you can handle it?\n\nThey call me Thomas: last name Crown\nRecognize game: I'mma lay mine's down\n\nI'm a big girl: I can handle myself\nBut if I get lonely I'mma need your help\nPay attention to me I don't talk for my health\n\nI want you on my team\nSo does everybody else\n\nShh: baby we can keep it on the low\nLet your guard down ain't nobody gotta know\n\nIf you with it girl: I know a place we can go\nWhat kind of girl do you take me for?\n\nPromiscuous girl\nWherever you are\nI'm all alone\nAnd it's you that I want\n\nPromiscuous boy\nYou already know\nThat I'm all yours\nWhat you waiting for?\n\nPromiscuous girl\nYou're teasing me\nYou know what I want\nAnd I got what you need\n\nPromiscuous boy\nLet's get to the point\n'Cause we're on a roll\nAre you ready?\n\nDon't be mad: don't get mean\nDon't get mad: don't be mean\nDon't be mad: don't get mean\nDon't get mad: don't be mean\n\nWait: I don't mean no harm\nI can see you with my t-shirt on\n\nI can see you with nothing on\nFeeling on me before you bring that on\n\n(Bring that on?) You know what I mean\nGirl: I'm a freak: you shouldn't say those things\n\nI'm only trying to get inside your brain\nTo see if you can work me the way you say\n\nIt's okay: it's alright\nI got something that you gon' like\n\nHey is that the truth or are you talking trash?\nIs your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?\n\nPromiscuous girl\nWherever you are\nI'm all alone\nAnd it's you that I want\n\nPromiscuous boy\nI'm calling your name\nBut you're driving me crazy\nThe way you're making me wait\n\nPromiscuous girl\nYou're teasing me\nYou know what I want\nAnd I got what you need\n\nPromiscuous boy\nWe're one and the same\nSo we don't gotta play games no more",

        "Lyrics": "Wyclef Jean\nLadies up in here tonight\nNo fighting: no fighting\nWe got the Refugees up in here\nNo fighting: no fighting\nShakira: Shakira\n\nI never really knew that she could dance like this\nShe makes a man wants to speak Spanish\nComo se llama: si: bonita: si: mi casa: su casa\nShakira: Shakira\n\nShakira\nOh baby: when you talk like that\nYou make a woman go mad\nSo be wise and keep on\nReading the signs of my body\n\nAnd I'm on tonight \nYou know my hips don't lie\nAnd I'm starting to feel it's right\nAll the attraction: the tension\nDon't you see baby: this is perfection\n\nWyclef Jean\nHey girl: I can see your body moving \nAnd it's driving me crazy\nAnd I didn't have the slightest idea\nUntil I saw you dancing\n\nAnd when you walk up on the dance floor\nNobody cannot ignore the way you move your body: girl\nAnd everything so unexpected: the way you right and left it\nSo you can keep on taking it\n\nI never really knew that she could dance like this\nShe makes a man want to speak Spanish\nComo se llama: si: bonita: si: mi casa: su casa\nShakira: Shakira\n\nShakira\nOh baby: when you talk like that\nYou make a woman go mad\nSo be wise and keep on\nReading the signs of my body\n\nAnd I'm on tonight\nYou know my hips don't lie\nAnd I am starting to feel you boy\nCome on let's go: real slow\nDon't you see baby: asi es perfecto\n\nOh I know I am on tonight: my hips don't lie\nAnd I am starting to feel it's right\nAll the attraction: the tension\nDon't you see baby: this is perfection\nShakira: Shakira\n\nOh boy: I can see your body moving\nHalf animal: half man\nI don't: don't really know what I'm doing\nBut you seem to have a plan\n\nMy will and self restraint \nHave come to fail now: fail now\nSee: I am doing what I can: but I can't so you know\nThat's a bit too hard to explain\n\nBaila en la calle de noche\nBaila en la calle de d&#xED;a\nBaila en la calle de noche\nBaila en la calle de d&#xED;a\n\nWyclef Jean\nI never really knew that she could dance like this\nShe makes a man want to speak Spanish\nComo se llama: si: bonita: si: mi casa: su casa\nShakira: Shakira\n\nShakira\nOh baby when you talk like that\nYou know you got me hypnotized\nSo be wise and keep on\nReading the signs of my body\n\nWyclef Jean\nSe&#xF1;orita: feel the conga\nLet me see you move like you come from Colombia\n\nMira en Barranquilla se baila as&#xED;: say it\nMira en Barranquilla se baila as&#xED;\n\nYeah\nShe's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me\nBack with the Fugees from a third world country\nI go back like when Pac carried crates for humpty humpty\nI need a whole club dizzy\n\nWhy the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians\nI ain't guilty: it's a musical transaction \nNo more do we snatch ropes \nRefugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats \n\nShakira\nI'm on tonight: my hips don't lie\nAnd I'm starting to feel you boy\nCome on let's go: real slow\nBaby: like this is perfecto\n\nOh: you know I am on tonight and my hips don't lie\nAnd I am starting to feel it's right\nThe attraction: the tension\nBaby: like this is perfection\n\nNo fighting\nNo fighting",

dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud: I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nGrindin' to see if they can see me lean\nI'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen\nPolice see me ride by: they can see the glean\nAnd my shine on the deck and the TV screen\n\nRide with a new chick: she like \"hold up\"\nNext to the PlayStation controller\nIs a full clip in my pistola\nTurn a jacker into a coma\n\nGirl: you ain't know: I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone\nJust tryin' to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies\nRide clean as hell: so I pull in ladies\nLaws on patrol and you know they hate me\n\nMusic turned all the way up into the maximum\nI got speakers: some niggas try to jack for some\nBut we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em\nWill have a nigga locked up in the maximum\n\nSecurity cell: I'm grippin' oak\nMusic loud and I'm tippin' slow\nTwin's steady twistin' like \"Hit this dough\"\nPolice pull up right behind and is in his throat\n\nWindows down: gotta stop pollution\nCD changes: niggas like: \"Who is that producin'?\"\nThis the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'\nGot warrants in every city except Houston\nBut I still ain't losin'\n\nThey see me rollin': they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nMy music's so loud :I'm swangin'\nThey hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nI been drinkin' and smokin'\nHoldin' shit cause a brother can't focus\nI gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope\nThis big ol' Excursion swervin' all up in the curve\n\nA nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey\nAnd the gin again: it's in again: we in the wind\nDoin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt\nAnd rollin' another one up: we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck\n\nI got a blunt up my right hand\n40 oz. in my lap freezin' my balls\nRoll another tree: green leaves and all\nComin' pretty deep: me and my dawgs\n\nYo: I gotta get back to backstreets\nWonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat\nGlock-Glock: shots to the block: we creep-creep\nPop-pop: hope cops don't see me on the low key\n\nWith no regard for the law: we dodge 'em like \"fuck 'em all\"\nBut I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all\nKeep a gun in car and a blunt to spark\nBut well if you want: nigga: you poppin' dark\nReady or not: we bust shots off in the air\nKrayzie Bone and Chamillionaire\n\nThey see me rollin': they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me

dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\n\nNow do what you think it so: I tried to let you go\nTurn on my blinker light and then I swang it slower\nAnd they upset for sho cause they think they know\nThat they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro\n\nSo they get behind me tryin' to check my tags\nLook at my rearview and they smilin'\nThinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong: well keep tryin'\nSteady denyin' that it's racial profilin'\n\nHouston: Texas: you can check my tags\nPull me over try to check my slab\nGlove compartment: gotta get my cash\nCause the crooked cops try to come up fast\n\nAnd bein' the baller that I am: I talk to them\nGivin' a damn about not feelin' my attitude\nWhen they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty\nBet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood\n\nI'ma laugh at you: and then I'm a have to cruise\nYeah: my number two on some old DJ Screw\nYou can't arrest me: plus you can't sue\nThis a message to the laws: tellin' them \"We hate you\"\n\nI can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known\nTippin' down: I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome\nBookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone\nLike they couldn't stop me: I'm 'bout to pull up at your home\nAnd it's on\n\nThey see me rollin': they hatin'\nPatrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin' to catch me ridin' dirty\nTryin'

Oh\n\n(Leave me alone) Leave me alone \n(Stupid love songs) Oh\nHey: don't make me think about her smile\nOr having my first child\nI'm letting go\nTurning off the radio\n\n'Cause I'm so sick of love songs \nSo tired of tears\nSo done with wishing\nShe was still here\n\nSaid I'm so sick of love songs\nSo sad and slow\nSo why can't I turn off the radio?\n(Why can't I turn off the radio?)\n\nSaid I'm so sick of love songs \nSo tired of tears\nSo done with wishing\nShe was still here\n\nSaid I'm so sick of love songs\nSo sad and slow\nWhy can't I turn off the radio?\n(Why can't I turn off the radio?)\n\nAnd I'm so sick of love songs \nSo tired of tears\nSo done with wishing\nYou were still here\n\nSaid I'm so sick of love songs\nSo sad and slow\nSo why can't I turn off the radio?\n(Why can't I turn off the radio?)\nWhy can't I turn off the radio?",

I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nLet him know that you know best\n'Cause after all you do know best\nTry to slip past his defense\nWithout granting innocence\n\nLay down a list of what is wrong\nThe things you've told him all along\nAnd pray to God he hears you\nAnd pray to God he hears you\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr brake with the ones you've followed\n\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life",

(It's been said before)\nOr what about her style? (Too obvious)\nI'm out of time\nShe's out the door\nI got to go for mine\n\nI think I'll say\n\nYo\nI don't know your name but excuse me miss\nI saw you from across the room\n\nAnd I got to admit that you got my attention\nYou're making me want to say yo\n\nI know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss\nI saved the last dance for you\nHow I look to keep you here with me oh baby\n\nNow shorty grab hold of my hand\nAnd let's pretend the flow is ours\nYou say you don't really dance\n\nDon't worry about it\nWe'll just one: two: step\nOne: two: step\n\nNow if the music is moving too fast\nGrab my hand a little tighter\nDon't be afraid to move a little closer\n\nGirl: there is something about you that makes me want to say\n\nYo\nI don't know your name but excuse me miss\nI saw you from across the room\n\nAnd I got to admit that you got my attention\nYou're making me want to say yo\n\nI know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss\nI saved the last dance for you\nHow I look to keep you here with me oh baby\n\nBreakdown\nI want to be where you are:\nAin't nothing wrong with dancing.\n\nBaby it's so romantic.\n\nBaby I can be in your heart.\n\nSo many things I want to tell you:\nI think that I should start by saying \"Yo.\"\n\nI don't know your name but excuse me miss\nI saw you from across the room\n\nI got to give her game proper:\nPpit it so she get it:\nThere she is - I got to stop her.\n\nI know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss\nI saved the last dance for you\nHow I look to keep you here with me oh baby.\n\nspoken:\nNow everybody just clap your hands like this (like this):\nJust clap your hands like this (whooo like this).\n\nAnd if your shorty is in the house tonight:\nJust grab her by the hand homie:\nMake her understand y'all was made to dance like this (like this).\n\nY'all was made to bounce like this (whoa like this).\n\nJust let her know she was made for you:\nAnd you want to do everything she want to man.\n\nLaughs\n\nWhoo!",

(show)\nI gave you everything\nAnd never asked for anything\nAnd look at me: I'm all alone (alone)\nSo before you start defendin'\nBaby: stop all your pretendin'...\nI know you know I know\nSo what's the point in being slow\nLet's get this show on the road today: hey...\n\nI'm looking for attention\nNot another question\nShould you stay or should you go?\nWell if you don't have the answer\nWhy you still standing here?\nHey: hey: hey: hey... just walk away\nJust walk away\nJust walk away\n\nI want a love: I want a fire\nTo feel the burn: my desires\nI want a man by my side\nNot a boy who runs and hides\nAre you gonna fight for me: die for me\nLive and breathe for me\nDo you care for me\n'Cause if you don't then just leave\n\nI'm looking for attention\nNot another question\nShould you stay or should you go?\nWell if you don't have the answer\nWhy you still standing here?\nHey: hey: hey: hey... just walk away\nJust walk away\nJust walk away\n\nIf you don't have the answer (walk away)\nWalk away (just walk away)\nJust leave (walk away)\nWalk away\n\nWalk away",

        "Lyrics": "Yeah ladies I know you tired of the same old thing:\nThings have become so mundane\nI mean your bedroom is so cold: so cold but I'm here to tell you\nI got a strategy we 'bout to heat it up.\n(I like that.)\n\nGirl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before\nBaby not the usually tonight we gettin' unpredictable\nSo try to roll wit me baby... baby\nI'm a make you feel like you never felt:\nGirl all because you let me get unpredictable.\n\nBaby: 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you wit me\nC ain't afta A and B when you wit me\nIt don't make sense right now but it will\nLater on when you see how I make you feel\nRegular ain't in my vocabulary\nWhen it comes to love makin' be the neither is missionary\nPositions: girl pick one better yet two\nNever mind that we tryin' all the fun So\n\nGirl: get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before\nYeah\nBaby not the usual tonight we gettin' unpredictable\nSo try to roll wit me baby\nBaby\nI'm a make you feel like you never felt:\nGirl: all because you let me get unpredictable.\n\nI know you're use to dinner and a movie\nWhy not be my dinner: while makin' a movie\nDo you get it get it\nDo you got it got it\nGood good good\nGirl: I knew you would\nSee what I got over a lot of fellas is that I'm more creative\nAnd soon you will see what I mean: what I mean so.\n\nGirl: get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before\nBaby not the usually tonight we gettin' unpredictable\nSo try to roll wit me baby... baby\nI'm a make you feel like you never felt:\nGirl all because you let me get unpredictable.\n\nLudacris\nAll Aboard!\nThe spontaneous express\nNever the less always the more\nFrom the pool table to the kitchen floor\nNext stops the G spot... Luda!\n(I like that.)\nI like it too baby.\nLet me put a little bit of excitement\nUp in yo lifestyle\nYou gotta know the times of the essence\nI'm talkin' right now\nI can get: get rid of that headache\nWhat you doin' tonight\nSome say that sex is overrated: but they just ain't doin' it right\nI keeps it interestin' baby just take them clothes off\nI'll be yo Tylenol just take me till you dose off\nWake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world\nYou'll wake up in the mornin' feelin' like another girl.\n\nGirl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before\nDone before\nBaby not the usually tonight we gettin' unpredictable\nSo try... So try to roll wit me baby\nBaby\nI'm a make you feel like you never felt:\nGirl all because you let me get unpredictable.",

(could you thro it ovr' yo shoulda) and not to mention my teeth\n'Cause they color coordinated\nComplimentin' the teeth\nOh bra (boy) dats!\n\nSo check out my swag\nDiamonds red white 'n' blue like the American flag\nBoy (do yo chain) iz so colorful\nN see I got that nice screen\nMy money I spend on jewels\nI call it my ice cream (chain chain chain chain)\n\nMy music give u a black eye\n'Cause of the beating\nThey think I am a mutant\nThey way a boy iz beasting (chain chain chain chain)\nI stay when 'n' sometime u a call it cheating\nYeah my boyz alwayz around\nLike iz a mee-ting\n\nIz that yo (do yo chain) chain\nBout 24 inches iz how low I let it hang (do yo chain)\nHow 'bout the ride 'n' let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain)\nJust by the chain you can tell a big kid do a stain (do yo chain)\nU know da name (do do do do do do do yo chain)\n\nIz that yo chain\nBout 24 inches iz how low I let it hang (do yo chain)\nHow 'bout the ride 'n' let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain)\nJust by the chain you can tell a big kid do a stain (do yo chain)\nI'm off the chain (do do do do do do do yo chain)\n\n(Do your chain hang low\nDo it wobble to da flo\nDo it shine n n the light\nIz it platinum iz it gold\nCould you throw it ov'r ya shoulda\nIf ya hott it make ya cold\nDo your chain hang low)\n\n(Do your chain hang low\nDo it wobble to da flo\nDo it shine n n the light\nIz it platinum iz it gold\nCould you throw it ov'r ya shoulda\nIf ya hott it make ya cold\nDo your chain hang low)",

        "Lyrics": "I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place \nI was looking for something I couldn't replace \nI was running away from the only thing I've ever known\n\nAnd like a blind dog without a bone\nI was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone\nI hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold\n\nI've been there: done that: I ain't looking back \nThe seeds I've sown: saving dimes: spending too much time on the telephone\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place that call me one of their own \nJust a hometown boy: born a rollin' stone\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact \nThere's only one place left I wanna go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright \n\nI went as far as I could: I tried to find a new face\nThere isn't one of these lines that I would erase\nI left a million miles of memories on that road \nAnd every step I take: I know that I'm not alone\nYou take the home from the boy: but not the boy from his home\nThese are my streets: the only life I've ever known:\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nWho says you can't go home?\nThere's only one place that call me one of their own \nJust a hometown boy: born a rollin' stone\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact \nThere's only one place left I wanna go\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nI've been there: done that: I ain't looking back\nIt's been a long: long road: feels like I've never left\nThat's how the story goes\n\nIt doesn't matter where you are: doesn't matter where you go \nIf it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road \nTake it in: take it with you when you go\nWho says you can't go home?\n\nWho says you can't go back?\nBeen all around the world and as a matter of fact \nThere's only one place left I wanna go\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright\n\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright\nWho says you can't go home?\nIt's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright: it's alright\nWho says you can't go home?",

When you\nYou just don't know? What's on\nThe other side of the door\nWhen you're walking out: talk about it\nEverything I tried to remember to say\nJust went out my head\nSo I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand\n'Cause I know\n\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut I gotta make the first move: 'cause if I don't: you gonna start hating me\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\nGirl: it's not you: it's me \nI kinda gotta figure out what I need\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut we know that we gotta go \nOur separate ways\nAnd I know it's hard but I gotta do it\nAnd it's killing me\n'Cause there's never a right time\nRight time to say goodbye\n\nGirl: I know your heart is breaking\nAnd a thousand times I\nFound myself asking: \"Why? Why?\"\nWhy am I taking so long to say this?\nBut trust me: girl: I never\nMeant to crush your world: and I never\nThought I would see the day we grew apart: and I wanna know\n\nHow do you let it go? When you\nYou just don't know? What's on\nThe other side of the door\nWhen you're walking out: talk about it\nGirl: I hope you understand\nWhat I'm tryin'a say\nWe just can't go on\nPretending that we get along\nGirl how you not gonna see it?\n\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut I gotta make the first move: 'cause if I don't: you gonna start hating me\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\nGirl: it's not you: it's me \nI kinda gotta figure out what I need\n\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut we know that we gotta go \nOur separate ways\nAnd I know it's hard: but I gotta do it\nAnd it's killing me\n'Cause there's never a right time\nRight time to say goodbye\n\nListen to your heart\nGirl: you know\nWe should be apart: baby: I\nI just can't do it\nI: I just can't do it\nListen to your heart\nGirl: you know\nWe should be apart: baby: I\nI just can't do it\nAnd sometimes it makes me wanna cry\n\nDo you hear me crying?\nThere's never a right time\n\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut I gotta make the first move: 'cause if I don't: you gonna start hating me\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\nGirl: it's not you: it's me \nI kinda gotta figure out what I need\n(About you and me)\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\n(Oh: no: it ain't)\nBut we know that we gotta go\n(Go) \nOur separate ways\n(Ways)\nAnd I know it's hard: but I gotta do it\nAnd it's killing me\n'Cause there's never a right time\nRight time to say goodbye\n\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut I gotta make the first move: 'cause if I don't: you gonna start hating me\n'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you\nGirl: it's not you: it's me \nI kinda gotta figure out what I need\n\nThere's never a right time to say goodbye\nBut we know that we gotta go \nOur separate ways\nAnd I know it's hard: but I gotta do it\nAnd it's killing me\n'Cause there's never a right time\nRight time to say goodbye",

I'm a Soul Survivor\nAsk about 'em in the street: the boy Jeezy a rida (Jeezy a rida)\nA hundred grand on my wrist: yeah life sucks (Ha Ha)\nFuck the club: dawg: I rather count a million bucks (Ay)\n\n(Verse 2 - Young Jeezy)\nAnother day: another dolla (dolla)-same block: same nigga: same part: same green\nI guess we got the same dreams (Ay)\nOr is it the same nightmares (nightmares)\nWe let the Thugs do it for us--we don't cry tears (That's right)\nReal niggaz don't budge\nWhen Mail Man got his time he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)\nI'm knee deep in the game\nSo when it's time to read up: I'm knee deep in the 'caine (Damn)\nReal talk: Look: I'm tellin' you mayne (tellin' you mayne)\nIf you get jammed up don't mention my name\nForgive me Lord--I know I ain't livin' right\nGotta feed the block: niggaz starvin': they got appitites (Ay)\nAnd this is er'day: it never gets old (Old)\nThought I was a juvenile stuck to the G-Code (Yeah)\nThis ain't a rap song: nigga this is my life (this is my life)\nAnd if the hood was a battlefield then I'd earn stripes (Yeah)\n\n(Verse 3 - Young Jeezy)\nGotta watch your every move 'cause them eyes be on you (eyes be on you)\nGotta drive real cool when them pi's be on you (pi's be on you)\nJust because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous)\nThem alphabet boards gotta us under survalence (Ay)\n(Lock Downs) They lock us in cages\nThe same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages\nI ain't cheat--played the hand I was dealt\nTried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself\n(Let's Get It) No nuts: no glory (no glory)\nMy biography: you damn right: the true story (Yeah)\nSet the city on fire: and I didn't even try (try)\nRun these streets all day: I can sleep when I die (Ay)\n\n(Bridge - Akon)\n'Cause if you lookin' for me you you can find me\nOn the block disobeyin' the law\nReal G--thoroughbred from the streets\nPants saggin' with my gun in my draws\nJust to keep on movin' now\nJust to keep on movin' now\nJust to keep on movin' now\nJust to keep on movin' now",

        "Lyrics": "Yeah\nIt's my life\nMy own words I guess\n\nHave you ever loved someone so much: you'd give an arm for?\nNot the expression: no: literally give an arm for\nWhen they know they're your heart\nAnd you know you were their armor\n\nAnd you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em\nBut what happens when karma turns right around and bites you\nAnd everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?\nWhat happens when you become the main source of a pain?\n\"Daddy: look what I made.\": dad's gotta go catch a plane\n\n\"Daddy: where's mommy? I can't find mommy: where is she?\"\nI don't know go play Hailie: baby: your daddy's busy\nDaddy's writing this song: this song ain't gonna write itself\nI'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself\n\nThen turn right around in that song and tell her you love her\nAnd put hands on her mother: who's a spitting image of her\nThat's Slim Shady: yeah baby: Slim Shady's crazy\nShady made me: but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby\n\nAnd when I'm gone: just carry on: don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing: so baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone: just carry on: don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing: so baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\n\nI keep having this dream: I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing\nShe keeps screaming: she don't want me to sing\n\"You're making mommy cry: why? Why is mommy crying?\"\nBaby: daddy ain't leaving no more: \"Daddy you're lying:\nYou always say that: you always say this is the last time.\nBut you ain't leaving no more: daddy you're mine.\"\n\nShe's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it\n\"Daddy please: daddy don't leave: daddy - no stop it!\"\nGoes in her pocket: pulls out a tiny necklace locket\nIt's got a picture: \"This'll keep you safe daddy: take it with ya.\"\n\nI look up: it's just me standing in the mirror\nThese fuckin' walls must be talking: 'cause man I can hear 'em\nThey're saying \"You've got one more chance to do right:\" and it's tonight\nNow go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late\nAnd just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\nIt turns to a stage: they're gone: and this spotlight is on\nAnd I'm singing\n\nAnd when I'm gone: just carry on: don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing: so baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone: just carry on: don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing: so baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\n\n60:000 people: all jumping out their seat\nThe curtain closes: they're throwing roses at my feet\nI take a bow and thank you all for coming out\nThey're screaming so loud: I take one last look at the crowd\n\nI glance down: I don't believe what I'm seeing\n\"Daddy it's me: help mommy: her wrists are bleeding:\"\nBut baby we're in Sweden: how did you get to Sweden?\n\"I followed you daddy: you told me that you weren't leavin'\n\n\"You lied to me Dad: and now you make mommy sad\nAnd I bought you this coin: it says 'Number One Dad'.\nThat's all I wanted: I just want to give you this coin.\nI get the point - fine: me and mommy are gone.\"\n\nBut baby wait: \"It's too late dad: you made the choice.\nNow go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.\"\nThat's what they want: they want you Marshall: they keep screamin' your name\nIt's no wonder you can't go to sleep: just take another pill\nYeah: I bet you you will. You rap about it: yeah: word: k-keep it real\n\nI hear applause: all this time I couldn't see\nHow could it be: that the curtain is closing on me\nI turn around: find a gun on the ground: cock it\nPut it to my brain and scream \"Die Shady!\" and pop it\n\nThe sky darkens: my life flashes: the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes\nThat's when I wake up: alarm clock's ringin': there's birds singin'\nIt's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging: I walk right up to Kim and kiss her\nTell her I miss her: Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister\nAlmost as if to say\n\nAnd when I'm gone: just carry on: don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing: so baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone: just carry on: don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing: so baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back",

        "Lyrics": "I've never been\nThe one to raise my hand\nThat was not me\nAnd now that's who I am\nBecause of you\nI am standing tall\n\nMy heart is full\nOf endless gratitude\nYou were the one\nThe one to guide me through\nNow I can see\nAnd I believe\nIt's only just beginning\n\nThis is what we dream about\nBut the only question with me now\nIs do I make you proud\nStronger than I've ever been now\nNever been afraid of standing out\nBut do I make you proud?\n\nI guess I've learned\nTo question is to grow\nThat you still have faith\nIs all I need to know\n\nI've learned to love\nMyself in spite of me\nAnd I've learned to\nWalk on the road that I believe\n\nThis is what we dream about\nBut the only question with me now\nIs do I make you proud\nStronger than I've ever been now\nNever been afraid of standing out\nBut do I make you proud?\n\nEverybody needs to rise up\nEverybody needs to be loved\nTo be loved\n\nThis is what we dream about\nBut the only question with me now\nIs do I make you: do I make you proud\n\nThis is what we dream about\nBut the only question with me now\nIs do I make you proud\nStronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)\nNever been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)\nBut do I make you proud?\n\nThis is what we dream about\nBut the only question with me now\nIs do I make you proud\nStronger than I've ever been now\nNever been afraid of standing out\nDo I make you proud?\nBut do I make you proud?\n\nThis is what we dream about\nBut the only question with me now\nIs do I make you: do I make you proud",
