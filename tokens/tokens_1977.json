        "Lyrics": "On a dark desert highway: cool wind in my hair\nWarm smell of colitas: rising up through the air\nUp ahead in the distance: I saw a shimmering light\nMy head grew heavy and my sight grew dim\nI had to stop for the night\nThere she stood in the doorway\nI heard the mission bell\nAnd I was thinking to myself\n\"This could be heaven or this could be hell\"\nThen she lit up a candle and she showed me the way\nThere were voices down the corridor\nI thought I heard them say\n\nWelcome to the Hotel California\nSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)\nSuch a lovely face\nPlenty of room at the Hotel California\nAny time of year (Any time of year)\nYou can find it here\n\nHer mind is Tiffany-twisted: she got the Mercedes bends: uh\nShe got a lot of pretty: pretty boys that she calls friends\nHow they dance in the courtyard: sweet summer sweat\nSome dance to remember: some dance to forget\n\nSo I called up the Captain\n\"Please bring me my wine!\"\nHe said: \"We haven't had that spirit here since 1969\"\nAnd still those voices are calling from far away\nWake you up in the middle of the night\nJust to hear them say\n\nWelcome to the Hotel California\nSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)\nSuch a lovely face\nThey livin' it up at the Hotel California\nWhat a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)\nBring your alibis\n\nMirrors on the ceiling\nThe pink champagne on ice\nAnd she said: \"We are all just prisoners here of our own device\"\nAnd in their masters' chambers\nThey gathered for the feast\nThey stab it with their steely knives\nBut they just can't kill the beast\n\nLast thing I remember: I was\nRunning for the door\nI had to find the passage back\nTo the place I was before\n\"Relax\": said the night man\n\"We are programmed to receive\nYou can checkout any time you like\nBut you can never leave\"",

I fell in love with her.\nShe wrote her number on the back of my hand.\nI called her up: I was all out of breath: I said:\n\"Come hear me play in my rock and roll band.\nI took a shower and I put on my best blue jeans.\nI picked her up in my new VW van.\nShe wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath.\nI said: \"Hi\". She said: \"Yeah: I guess I am.\"\n\nAriel'\n\nWe had a little time: we were real hungry.\nWe went to Dairy Queen for something to eat.\nShe had some onion rings. She had a pickle.\nShe forgot to tell me that she didn't eat meat.\nI had a gig in the American Legion Hall.\nIt was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corp.\nShe was sitting in a corner against the wall.\nShe would smile and I melted all over the floor.\n\nAriel'\n\nI took her home with me. We watched some TV:\nAnnette Funicello and some guy going steady.\nI started fooling around with the vertical hold.\nWe got the munchies and I made some spaghetti.\nWe sat and we talked into the night:\nWhile channel 2 was signing off the air.\nI found the softness of her mouth.\nWe made love to bombs bursting in Ariel'.\n\nAriel'",

        "Lyrics": "I love you: so much\nSomewhere back in time\nYou became a friend of mine\nAnd day by day we've grown a little closer\nYou're my spirit to be strong\nA friend when things go wrong\nSo I've written down these words to let you know\n\nLoves grown deep: deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nLet us plant the seed and watch it grow\nLoves grown deep: deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\n\nAs we travel down the road\nSide-by-side we'll share the load\nHand-in-hand we'll see each other through\nThough we've only just begun\nLet's count our blessings one-by-one\nI thank God for life: I thank God for you\n\nLoves grown deep: deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nLet us plant the seed and watch it grow\nLoves grown deep: deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\n\nAnd as the seasons slip away\nForever lovers we will stay\nTogether: do-or-die: with all our hearts\n\nLoves grown deep: deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me\nLet us plant the seed and watch it grow\nLoves grown deep: deep into the heart of me\nYou've become a part of me",

        "Lyrics": "How much love do you need \nBefore you give your love to me \nHow much time before it grows \nHow much love I wanna know \n\nWhat can I do what can I say \nThe last thing I want is to drive you away \nHow much love does it take \nHow much love for heaven sake \n\nHow much love how much love \nDo I rush right in or do I hesitate \nHow much love how much love how much love \n\nAm I tryin' too hard \nGive me some kind of clue \nThere must be a way to get through to you \nShould I come on strong or do I hesitate \nDo I rush right in or do I wait \n\nHow much love how much love \nDo I rush right in or do I hesitate \nHow much love how much love how much love \n\nI got so much love \nDon't know where to begin \nI'm pleadin' with you babe \nYou gotta let me in",
