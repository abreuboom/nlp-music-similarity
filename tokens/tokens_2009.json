I don't know what to think.\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...\n\n\"Marry me: Juliet: you'll never have to be alone\nI love you: and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad: go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story: baby: just say...yes!\"\n\nOh: oh: oh\nOh: oh: oh: oh\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!",

        "Lyrics": "(T.I.)\nAy: this a special what's happenin' to all my\nAll my soldiers over there in Iraq\nEverybody right here\nWhat you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nStop lookin' at what you ain't got: start bein' thankful for what you do got\nLet's give it to 'em: baby girl: hey\n\nYou're gonna be a shining star\nWith fancy clothes and fancy cars\nAnd then you see: you're gonna go far\n'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna: let's get it)\n\nSo live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay\nYou steady chasin' that paper\nJust live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay\nAin't got no time for no haters\n\nJust live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay\nNo telling where it'll take ya\nJust live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay\n(Joss: we did it again homie)\n'Cause I'm a paper chaser\n\nJust livin' my life: my life: my life\nJust livin' my life: my life: my life\n\nNevermind what haters say: ignore 'em 'til they fade away\nAmazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away\nSafe to say: I paved the way for you cats to get paid today\nYou still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day\n\nConsider them my prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;: homage I think they should pay\nInstead of being gracious: they violate in a major way\nI never been a hater: still I love 'em in a crazy way\nSome say they sold the yay: and no: they couldn't get work on Labor Day\n\nIt ain't that black or white: it has an area the shade of gray\nI'm West Side anyway: even if I left today and stayed away\nSome move away to make a way: not move away 'cause they afraid\nI brought back to the hood: and all you ever did was take away\n\nI pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away\nLike I once made 'em spray: now I could make them put the K's away\nBeen thuggin' all my life: can't say I don't deserve to take a break\nYou rather see me catch a case: then watch my future fade away\n\nYou're gonna be a shining star\nWith fancy clothes and fancy cars\nAnd then you see: you're gonna go far\n'Cause everyone knows who you are\n\nSo live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay\nYou steady chasin' that paper\nJust live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay\nAin't got no time for no haters\n\nJust live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay\nNo telling where it'll take ya\nJust live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay\n'Cause I'm a paper chaser\n\nJust livin' my life: my life: my life\nJust livin' my life: my life: my life\n\n(T.I.)\nI'm the opposite of moderate: immaculately polished with\nThe spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid\nAllergic to the counterfeit: impartial to the politics\nArticulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick\n\nWhoever havin' problems with they record sales: just holla T.I.P.\nIf that don't work and all else fails: then turn around and follow T.I.P.\nI got love for the game: but ay: I'm not in love with all of it\nCould do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical\n\nThe hootin' and the hollerin': back and forth with the arguin'\n\"Where you from? Who you know? What you makin'? What kind of car you in?\"\nSeems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'\nThem checks into ya bank account: and you've up out of poverty\n\nYour values is in disarrayed: prioritizin' horribly\nUnhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally\nIgnorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'\nAnd we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden: aren't we?\n\nYou're gonna be a shining star\nWith fancy clothes and fancy cars\nAnd then you see: you're gonna go far\n'Cause everyone knows who you are\n\nSo live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay\nYou steady chasin' that paper\nJust live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay\nAin't got no time for no haters\n\nJust live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay\nNo telling where it'll take ya\nJust live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay\n'Cause I'm a paper chaser\n\nJust livin' my life: (ay) my life: (oh) my life (ay)\nJust livin' my life: (ay) my life: (oh) my life (ay)\n\nGot everybody watchin' what I do\nCome walk in my shoes\nAnd see the way I'm livin:' if you really want to\nGot my mind on my money: and I'm not goin' nowhere\n\nSo keep on gettin' your paper: and keep on climbin'\nAnd look in the mirror: and keep on shinin'\n'Til the game end: 'til the clock stop\nWe gon' post up on the top spot\n\nLivin' the life: my life\nIn a brand new city: got my whole team wit' me\nThe life: my life: I do what I wanna do\nI'm livin' my life: my life: I will never lose\nI'm livin' my life: my life and I'm not stopping\n\nSo live your life",

(down: down)\nBaby: are you down down down down down? (down: down)\nEven if the sky is falling down\n\nJust let it be\nCome on and bring your body next to me\nI'll take you away\nTurn this place into our private getaway\n\nSo leave it behind\n'Cause we have a night to get away\nSo come on and fly with me\nAs we make our great escape\nSo why don't we run away?\n\nSo baby: don't worry: you are my only\nYou won't be lonely: even if the sky is falling down\nYou'll be my only: no need to worry\nBaby: are you down down down down down? (down: down)\nBaby: are you down down down down down? (down: down)\nEven if the sky is falling down\n\nLil Wayne\nDown like she supposed to be: she gets down low for me\nDown like her temperature: 'cause to me she zero degrees\nShe cold: like overfreeze: I got that girl from overseas\nNow she's my Miss America: now can I be her soldier: please\n\nI'm fighting for this girl on a battlefield of love\nDon't it look like baby cupid sent his arrows from above\nDon't you ever leave the side of me\nIndefinitely: not probably\nAnd honestly I'm down like the economy: yeah\n\nJay Sean\nSo baby: don't worry: you are my only\nYou won't be lonely: even if the sky is falling down\nYou'll be my only: no need to worry\nBaby: are you down down down down down?

        "Lyrics": "I can almost see it\nThat dream I'm dreaming: but\nThere's a voice inside my head saying:\n\"You'll never reach it\"\nEvery step I'm taking\nEvery move I make feels: lost with no direction\nMy faith is shakin'\nBut I: I gotta keep trying\nGotta keep my head held high\n\nThere's always gonna be another mountain\nI'm always gonna wanna make it move\nAlways gonna be an uphill battle\nSometimes I'm gonna have to lose\nAin't about how fast I get there\nAin't about what's waiting on the other side\nIt's the climb\n\nThe struggles I'm facing\nThe chances I'm taking\nSometimes might knock me down: but\nNo: I'm not breaking\nI may not know it: \nBut these are the moments that:\nI'm gonna remember most: yeah\nJust gotta keep going\nAnd I: I gotta be strong\nJust keep pushing on: 'cause\n\nThere's always gonna be another mountain\nI'm always gonna wanna make it move\nAlways gonna be an uphill battle\nSometimes I'm gonna have to lose\nAin't about how fast I get there\nAin't about what's waiting on the other side\nIt's the climb\n\nYeah\n\nThere's always gonna be another mountain\nI'm always gonna wanna make it move\nAlways gonna be an uphill battle\nSometimes: you're gonna have to lose\nAin't about how fast I get there\nAin't about what's waiting on the other side\nIt's the climb\n\nYeah-yeah-yeah\n\nKeep on moving\nKeep climbing\nKeep the faith: baby\nIt's all about: it's all about the climb\nKeep the faith: keep your faith: \nWhoa-whoa-oh",

To push a fucking Rav 4\nBut I know that if I stay stunting\nAll these girls only gon want one thing\nI can spend my whole life good will hunting\nOnly good gon come is it's good when I'm coming\nShe got an ass that'll swallow up a G-string\nAnd up top: uh: two bee stings\nAnd I'm feasting off the Riesling\nAnd my nigga just made it out the precinct\nWe give a damn 'bout the drama that you do bring\nI'm just tryin' change the color of your mood ring\nReebok: baby: you need to try some new things\nHave you ever had shoes without shoe strings?\nWhat's that: Ye? Baby: these heels\nIs that a May... what?? Baby: these wheels\nYou tripping when you ain't sipping: have a refill\nYou feelin' like you running: huh? \nNow you know how we feel\n\nWassup (Jay-Z)\n\nHey: hey: hey\nWe goin' run this town tonight\n\nWassup (Jay-Z)",

Birthday sex\nBirthday sex... Birthday sex\n\nSee you sexy and them jeans got me on tent\n1-2-3 Ding: I got you pinned\nDon't tap out: fight until the end\nRing that bell: and we gonna start over again\nWe grinding with passion: 'cause it's your birthday\nBeen at it for hours: I know you thirsty\nYou kiss me so sweetly: taste just like Hershey's\nJust tell me how you want you gift: girl\n\nGirl you know I-I-I: Girl you know I-I-I\nI been feenin:\nWake up in the late night\nBeen dreaming bout your loving: girl\nGirl you know I-I-I: Girl you know I-I-I\nDon't need candles and cake\nJust need your body to make...\nBirthday sex... Birthday sex\nBirthday sex... Birthday sex\n\nFirst: I'm gonna take a dive into the water:\nDeep until I know I pleased that body\nOr girl without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet\nAnd make you wanna tell somebody... how I do\nOr maybe we can float on top my water bed\nYou close your eyes as I I'm-prov between your legs\nWe work our way from kitchen stoves and tables:\nGirl: you know I'm only able to please\nSay you wanted flowers on the bed\nBut you got me and now it's on again\n\nGirl you know I-I-I: Girl you know I-I-I\nI been feeling:\nWake up in the late night\nBeen dreaming bout your loving: girl\nGirl you know I-I-I: Girl you know I-I-I\nDon't need candles and cake\nJust need your body to make...\nBirthday sex...

Who's got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us: my posse's kicking up dust\nIt's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk\n\nOk! Let's go!\n\nBack with Andre the Giant: Mr. Elephant Tusk\nFix your musk: you'll be just another one bit the dust\nJust one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus\nKiss my butt: lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts\n\nIt disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks\nIt's a must: I redeem my name and haters get mushed\nBitches lust: man they love me when I lay in the cut\nFist the cup: the lady give her eighty some paper cut\n\nNow picture us: it's ridiculous: you curse at the thought\n'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce\nIf I could fit the words as picture perfect: works every time\nEvery verse: every line: as simple as nursery rhymes\n\nIt's elementary: the elephants have entered the room\nI venture to say with the center of attention: \"It's true\"\nNot to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal\nOf the bat symbol: the platinum trio's back on you hoes\n\nSo crack a bottle: let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model: you just hit the lotto\nUh-oh: uh-oh: bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes\n\nNow where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us: my posse's kicking up dust\nIt's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk\n\nLadies and gentlemen... Dr. Dre!\n\nDr. Dre\nThey see that low rider go by: they like: \"Oh: my!\"\nYou ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why\nI dip through in that six tre like: \"Sick 'em: Dre\"\nI'm an itch that they can't scratch: they're sick of me\n\nBut hey: what else can I say? I love L.A.\n'Cause over and above all: it's just another day\nAnd this one begins where the last one ends\nPick up where we left off and get smashed again\n\nI'll be damned: just fucked around and crashed my Benz\nDriving 'round with a smashed front end: let's cash that one in\nGrab another one from out the stable\nThe Monte Carlo: El Camino or the El Dorado\n\nThe hell if I know: do I want leather seats or vinyl?\nDecisions: decisions: garage looks like precision collision\nOr maico: beats quake like Waco\nJust keep the bass low speakers away from your face though\n\nEminem\nSo crack a bottle: let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model: you just hit the lotto\nUh-oh: uh-oh: bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes\n\nNow where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us: my posse's kicking up dust\nIt's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk\n\nAnd I take great pleasure in introducing... 50 Cent!\n\n50 Cent\nIt's bottle after bottle\nThe money ain't a thang when you party with me\nIt's what we into: it's simple\nWe ball out of control like you wouldn't believe\n\nI'm the napalm: the bomb: the Don: I'm King Kong\nGet rolled on: wrapped up and reigned on\nI'm so calm through Vietnam: ring the alarm\nBring the Chandon: burn marajaun do what you want\n\nNigga on and on till the break of what?\nGet the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck\nI spend it like it don't mean nothing\nBlow it like it's supposed to be blown: Mafucker: I'm grown\n\nI stunt: I style: I flash the shit\nI gets what the fuck I want: so what? I trick\nFat ass: burgundy bags: classy shit\nJimmy Choo shoes: I say: \"Move a-bitch: move\"\n\nEminem\nSo crack a bottle: let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model: you just hit the lotto\nUh-oh: uh-oh: bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes\n\nNow where's the rubbers?

It's safer to ask it\nSo get that nigga I will pay for the casket\nThat Remy ma got you talkin' plenty huh?\nBroke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar\nSo get with Loso\nHe ain't got to know so\nI'm a gentlemen I send a bottle with that Rose tho'\nOh you gotta man well you need a richer one\nMeet me in the parking lot: the plates say 'getchu1'\nMeet me at the register\nI'm there on the regular\nThey just price checkin'\nYou can help them in a second\nAs we proceed to get you what you need\nLike we breakin' down the weed\nShortie throw it in the bag\n\n(Chorus: The-Dream)\nUn-huh un-huh un-huh\nJust throw it in the bag\nUn-huh un-huh un-huh\nJust throw it in the bag\nUn-huh un-huh un-huh\nJust throw it in the bag\nUn-huh un-huh un-huh\nJust throw it in the bag",

This is my theme park\nMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side: you don't want to hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk: check the price and pay attention\nLil Wayne: that's what they got to say or mention\nI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer\nI'm resting in the lead: I need a pillow and a cover\nShhh: my foot's sleepin' on the gas\nNo brake pads: no such thing as last\nUh: uh\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\n\nThere they go: packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow\nNuts they go: Macadamian: they go so ballistic: whoa\nHe can make them look like bozos: he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow\nFuck no: go for broke: his cup just runneth over: oh: no\nHe ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed\nThey been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before\nBashin' in the brains of these hoes: and establishin' a name as he goes\nThe passion and the flame is ignited: you can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot\nYou dealin' with a few true villains who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'\nAnd spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths: now rewind it\nPayback: motherfucker: for the way that you got at me: how's it taste:\nWhen I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?\nI'm Hannibal Lector: so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face\nYou ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place: so Drake\n\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)\nI'm shutting shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever: mine (ever mine: ever mine)",

Hey!\n\nHow we ball in the club I know you hate it\nMami dancin on the floor all like she naked\nWhen she lay down with you I know she fake it\nAll the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it\nOh! Pop champagne!\nOh! Pop champagne!\nOh! We pop champagne!\nOh! We pop champagne!\n\nWe need more bottles tell ma hurry up\nTell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America\nGimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up\nKnow it's me when you see this fur in your area\nAnd she call me all night cause you can get it up\nOn my neck on my wrist everything is litted up\nDrinkin' bottles of that Clique till I spit it up\nOnly get one life so you gotta live it up\n(HEY!) If you in the things I'm in\nShorty we can be friends: shorty we can be friends\nRight now: I wanna see you dance: see you dance\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\n\nWhen I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)\nBrand new 'rarri and the roof drop back (The 60)\nCame through Harlem like the Rooftop back (AIYYO!)\nMoney in the bank man you know don't stop that (Stop that stop that stop that!)\n(*Oh!) Now we tryin' to get up in the club\n(*Oh!) Try to tell me no 'cause I'm rollin' with the thugs\n(We got money bitch!) Until I flash a couple of dollars (Yep!)\nTell 'em we only want tables and we buyin out the bottles\n(*Oh!) Y'all know the order\nTell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!)\nOnly Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)\nTen thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)\nWe standin on couches: a couple of women (Hey baby)\nWe was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)\nHe told shorty we could be friends (Yep)\nAnd your friends could meet with my friends (What else)\nAnd we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday\nWe could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way\nSHIT! We could get in on three way (Oh)\nBlackberry two way: souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)\nWe superstars no Lupe: we could do this like a duet\nBut y'all be the singers on the mic: wait let me dim the lights\nThis was in the car while I was stoppin' at the light\n\nHow we ball in the club I know you hate it\nMami dancin on the floor all like she naked\nWhen she lay down with you I know she fake it\nAll the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it\nOh! Pop champagne!\nOh! Pop champagne!\nOh! We pop champagne!\nOh! We pop champagne!\n\nBaby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)\nWithout no shirt: without those pants\nPop champagne ain't a damn thing change\nSpray it in the air make it champagne rain\nBuckets of ice keep the champagne cool\nMami got a body see that damn thing move\nIt's no sex in the champagne room\nSays who? Baby I'll break all rules\nBring it here and I'll break off you\nShe see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through\nWhen she with you she lyin' but she fake it\nWhen she with me she like it she never fake it\n\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\nI wanna see you dance: see you dance\n\nHow we ball in the club I know you hate it\nMami dancin on the floor all like she naked\nWhen she lay down with you I know she fake it\nAll the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it\nOh! Pop champagne!\nOh! Pop champagne!\nOh! We pop champagne!\nOh! We pop champagne!",
