        "Lyrics": "Jessie is a friend\nYeah I know he's been a good friend of mine\nBut lately something's changed\nIt ain't hard to define\nJessie's got himself a girl\nAnd I want to make her mine\nAnd she's watching him with those eyes\nAnd she's lovin' him with that body: I just know it\nAnd he's holding her in his arms late: late at night\n\nYou know I wish that I had Jessie's girl\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\nWhy can't I find a woman like that?\n\nI'll play along with this charade\nThere doesn't seem to be a reason to change\nYou know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute\nI wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot\n'Cause she's watching him with those eyes\nAnd she's lovin' him with that body: I just know it\nAnd he's holding her in his arms late: late at night\n\nYou know I wish that I had Jessie's girl\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\nWhy can't I find a woman like that?\n\nLike Jessie's girl\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\nWhy can't I find a woman?\nWhy can't I find a woman like that?\n\nAnd I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time\nWonderin' what she don't see in me\nI've been funny; I've been cool with the lines\nAin't that the way love's supposed to be?\nTell me why can't I find a woman like that?\n\nYou know I wish that I had Jessie's girl\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\nWhy can't I find a woman like that?\nLike Jessie's girl\n\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\nI want: I want Jessie's girl",

I couldn't go on\n\nBut if you insist on knowing my bliss\nI'll tell you this\nIf you want to know what the reason is\nI only smile when I lie: then I'll tell you why\n\nBecause your kiss: your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss: your kiss I can't resist\nBecause your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light\n\nI really miss you: babe\n\nBecause your kiss: your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss: your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss is on my list of the best things in life\nOh babe: because your kiss: your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss: your kiss I can't resist\nBecause your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light\nBecause your kiss: your kiss is on my list\nBecause your kiss: your kiss I can't resist\nBecause your kiss is on my list of the best things in life\nOhh: because your kiss: your kiss is on my list...",

Are you satisfied?\nHow long can you stand the heat?\nOut of the doorway: the bullets rip-ah\nTo the sound of the beat: look out!\n\nAnother one bites the dust-ah\nAnother one bites the dust-ah\nAnd another one gone and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust: hey\nHey: I'm gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nHey!\nAw: take it!\nBite the dust!\nBite the dust: yeah!\n\nHey-uh\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust: ow!\nAnother one bites the dust: hey hey!\nAnother one bites the dust \nHey: yeah: yeah: yeah: hey\nOoh: shooter!\n\nThere are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man\nAnd bring him to the ground\nYou can beat him: you can cheat him: you can treat him bad \nAnd then leave him when he's down: yeah\n\nBut I'm ready: yes: I'm ready for you\nI'm standing on my own two feet\nOut of the doorway: the bullets rip\nRepeating to the sound of the beat\nSo: yeah\n\nAnother one bites the dust-ah\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust: yeah\nHey: I'm gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\nOh: shooter!\nAy: hey\nAll right",

Feels so right.\n\nLying here beside you I hear the echoes of your sighs\nPromise me you'll stay with me and keep me warm tonight\nSo hold me close and love me: give my heart a smile\nMmm feels so right. Feels so right.\n\nYour body feels so gentle and my passion rises high\nYou're loving me so easy: you're wish is my command\nJust hold me close and love me: tell me it won't end\nMmm feels so right. Feels so right.\n\nFeels so right.\n\nAh: you feel so right baby...",

Losing you now\nHow can I win?\nWhere will I be tomorrow?\n\nWas there a moment when I cut you down?\nPlayed around?\nWhat have I done?!\nI only apologize\nFor being: as they say: the last to know\nIt has to show\nWhen someone is in your eyes...\n\nWhat: what kind of fool\nTears it apart\nLeaving me pain and sorrow?\nLosing you now\nWondering why\nWhere will I be tomorrow?\nWhat: what kind of fool\nTears it apart\nLeaving me pain and sorrow?\nLosing you now\nHow can I win\nWhere will I be tomorrow?",
