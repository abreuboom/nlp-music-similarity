        "Lyrics": "Yeah: yeah (Ooh)\nUh: hey hey\nAll right: yeah\n\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\n\nI wanna take a minute or two: and give much respect due\nTo the man that's made a difference in my world\nAnd although most men are ho's he flows on the down low\n'Cause I never heard about him with another girl\nBut I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic\nTo let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd\nI know that ain't nobody perfect: I give props to those who deserve it\nAnd believe me y'all: he's worth it\nSo here's to the future 'cause we got through the past\nI finally found somebody that can make me laugh\n(Ha ha ha) You so crazy\nI think I wanna have your baby\n\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\n\nMy man is smooth like Barry: and his voice got bass\nA body like Arnold with a Denzel face\nHe's smart like a doctor with a real good rep\nAnd when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep\nHe always got a gift for me every time I see him\nA lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him\nHe never ran a corny line once to me yet\nSo I give him stuff that he'll never forget\nHe keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps\nHe's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp\nHe dresses like a dapper don: but even in jeans\nHe's a God-sent original: the man of my dreams\n\nYes: my man says he loves me: never says he loves me not\nTryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot\nSee other guys that I've had: they tried to play all that mac shit\nBut every time they tried I said: \"That's not it\"\nBut not this man: he's got the right potion\nBaby: rub it down and make it smooth like lotion\nYeah: the ritual: highway to heaven\nFrom seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven\nAnd yes: it's me that he's always choosin'\nWith him I'm never losin': and he knows that my name is not Susan\nHe always has heavy conversation for the mind\nWhich means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find\n\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\n\nMy man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer\nHe's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am: he's a thriller\nHe takes his time and does everything right\nKnocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night\nHe's a real smooth brother: never in a rush\nAnd he gives me goose pimples with every single touch\nSpends quality time with his kids when he can\nSecure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man\nA lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out\nDon't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about\nEvery time I need him: he always got my back\nNever disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that\n\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man\nWhat a man: what a man: what a man\nWhat a mighty good man",

It is where we are\nIt's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer: that we got this far\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds: believe the very best\n\nThere's a time for everyone if they only learn\nThat the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn\nThere's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors\nWhen the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours\n\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are\nIt's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer: that we got this far\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds: believe the very best\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds: believe the very best",

        "Lyrics": "Come on y'all let's take a ride\nDon't ya say shit just get inside\nIt's time to take your ass on another kind of trip\n'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip\nGrab you gat with the extra clip\nAnd close your eyes and hit the switch\nWe're going to a place where everybody kick it: kick it: kick it\nYeah that's the ticket\nAin't no bloodin\nAin't no crippin\nAin't no punk ass niggaz set trippin'\nEverybody got a stack and it ain't no crack\nAnd it really don't matter if you're white or black\nI wanna take you there like the Staple Singers\nPut something in the tank: and I know that I can bring ya\nIf ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen\nWe on a mission\n\nCome along and ride on a fantastic voyage\nSlide: slide slippity slide\nI'm hittin switches on the block in a 65\nCome along and ride on fantastic voyage\nSlide slide hoo ride: ain't no valley low enough or mountain high\n\nI'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and\nMaybe eat some steak with my beans and rice\nA place where my kids can play outside without livin' in fear of a drive by\nAnd even if I get away from them drive by killaz\nI still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggaz\nI keep on searchin and I keep on lookin'\nBut niggaz are the same from Watts to Brooklyn\nI try to keep my faith in my people\nBut sometimes my people be actin' like they evil\nYou don't understand about runnin' with a gang\nCause you don't gang bang\nAnd you don't have to stand on the corner and slang\nCause you got your own thang\nYou can't help me if you can't help yourself\nYou better make a left\n\nCome along and ride on a fantastic voyage\nSlide: slide slippity slide\nI do what I do just to survive\nCome along and ride on a fantastic voyage\nSlide slide hoo ride: that's why I pack my 45\n\nLife is a bitch and then you die\nStill trying to get a piece of that apple pie\nEvery game ain't the same cause the game still remain\nDon't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed\nIf you don't work then you don't eat\nAnd only down ass niggaz can ride with me\nHip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block\nStay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock\nYou gotta have heart son if you wanna go\nWatch this sweet chariot swing low\nAin't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'\nAin't nobody worryin everybody's tryin'\nNothing from nothin' leaves nothin'\nIf you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin\nWhat you gonna do when the 5 rolls by\nYou better be ready so you can ride\n\nCome along and ride on a fantastic voyage\nSlide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die\nCome along and ride on a fantastic voyage\nSlide slide hoo ride you better be ready for the 5 rolls by\n\nJust roll along (that's what you do)\nJust roll along (that's right)\nJust roll along (that's what you do)\nJust roll along (that's right)\n\nDo you want to ride with me\n(Repeat 9 times)",

Mount up!\n\nIt was a clear black night: a clear white moon\nWarren G. was on the streets: trying to consume\nSome skirts for the eve: so I can get some phones\nRollin' in my ride: chillin' all alone\n\nJust hit the Eastside of the LBC\nOn a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.\nSeen a car full of girls: ain't no need to tweak\nAll you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3\n\nSo I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis\nSome brothas shootin' dice so I said \"Let's do this\"\nI jumped out the ride: and said \"What's up?\"\nSome brothas pulled some gats so I said \"I'm stuck.\"\n\nSince these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve\nThese hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb\nWon't 'cha think of better things than some horny tricks\nI see my homey and some suckers all in his mix\n\nI'm gettin' jacked: I'm breakin' myself\nI can't believe they taking Warren's wealth\nThey took my rings: they took my Rolex\nI looked at the brotha said \"Damn: what's next?\"\n\nThey got my homey hemmed up and they all around\nCan't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound\nThey wanna come up real quick before they start to clown\nI best pull out my strap and lay them busters down\n\nThey got guns to my head\nI think I'm going down\nI can't believe this happenin' in my own town\nIf I had wings I would fly\nLet me contemplate\nI glance in the cut and I see my homey Nate\n\nSixteen in the clip and one in the hole\nNate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold\nNow they droppin' and yellin'\nIt's a tad bit late\nNate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate\n\nI laid all them busters down\nI let my gat explode\nNow I'm switching my mind back into freak mode\nIf you want skirts sit back and observe\nI just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb\n\nNow Nate got the freaks\nAnd that's a known fact\nBefore I got jacked I was on the same track\nBack up: back up 'cause it's on\nN-A-T-E and me\nThe Warren to the G.\n\nJust like I thought\nThey were in the same spot\nIn need of some desperate help\nThe Nate Dogg and the G. Child\nWere in need of something else\nOne of them dames was sexy as hell\nI said \"Ooh: I like your size\"\nShe said \"My car's broke down and you sing real nice:\nWould ya let me ride?\"\nI got a car full of girls and it's going real swell\nThe next stop is the Eastside Motel\n\nI'm tweaking\nInto a whole new era\nG-Funk\nStep to this: I dare ya\nFunk: on a whole new level\n\nThe rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble\n\nChords\nStrings\nWe brings\nMelody\nG-Funk\nWhere rhythm is life\nAnd life is rhythm\n\nIf you know like I know\nYou don't wanna step to this\nIt's the G-Funk era\nFunked out with a gangsta twist\nIf you smoke like I smoke\nThen you're high like everyday\nAnd if your ass is a buster\n2-1-3 will regulate",

(Double-barrel buckshot)\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me?\n\nForces of evil in a bozo nightmare\nBan all the music with a phony gas chamber\n'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag\nOne's on the pole: shove the other in a bag\n\nWith the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job\nThe daytime crap of the folksinger slob\nHe hung himself with a guitar string\nA slab of turkey neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing\n\nYou can't write if you can't relate\nTrade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate\nAnd my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite\nWho's choking on the splinters\n\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me? (Get crazy with the Cheez Whiz)\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me? (Drive-by body-pierce)\n\nYo: bring it on down: soy\n(I'm a driver: I'm a winner)\n(Things are gonna change I can feel it)\n\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me? (I can't believe you)\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me? (Uh)\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me? (Oh: sprechen Sie Deutsch: baby?)\nSoy un perdedor: I'm a loser baby\nSo why don't you kill me? (You know what I'm sayin'?)",

Wait\nDamn: the street lights just came on\nAnd my momma's on the streets tellin' me to come home\nI hit the gate and I hops on my Schwinn\nAnd I tell the homies: \"aiight then\": yeah\n\nVerse two: now what the fuck I do?\nCatch the bus to Cal State or chill with the Voltron crew\nAnd make a few ends on the side\nHere comes a baby blue van: time to ride\nSo I hops in the van with my nigga Tick\nAnd Baby Poppa: back then: that was my click\nWe groovin' to Santa Ana\nAnd we plan on makin' hellafied 'mount of money hell yeah\nAnd what I did for extra fees\nWas break niggaz after work playin' get like me\nI was fourteen years old: havin' a sack\nJust a young mutha fucka eatin' Valupacks\nShootin' dice in the corners of the public schools\nAnd I used to gangbang: but now it's a G thang\nAnd I still know how to make those ends\nYou don't believe me? Go ask the twinz mutha fucka\n\nYeah: check dis out: dis is I'm O.G.L.B.\nKnow what I'm sayin'? I'mon my little O.G. Warren G\nAnd he just droppin' dis to let you B.G.'s know\nWhat's happen: y'all got to recognize\n'Cause this is ya know a Long Beach thang\n21st Street: but check dis out\nG gonna go out there: ya know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd handle that shit ya know? yeah\n\n(Hey Greg: I hope yo' was tapin' that shit)",

(BOY!) Man's indisputed and deep-rooted\nFunk smoke that leaves your brains booted\nThis bad M.C. with stamina like Bruce Jenner the winner\nTasting M.C.'s for dinner\nYou're crazy like that glue (you're crazy: boy: You're crazy.)\nTo think that you could out-do my one-two that's sick like the flu (shake 'em down: Mack)\nBoy: I flip boy all the time\n'Cause boy: the rhyme you're kickin' ain't worth a dime (HA! BOY!)\nSeems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition\nYou come around: I'll knock you out position (knock 'em out!)\nNo flav could ever dig a grave for the Mack\nThe power pack in black makin' cement crack (make it crack)\nAnd here comes the brand new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear\n\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Here- comes- the- brand- new- flavor-\nTime for new flava in ya ear (in- your- ear-)\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (BOY!)\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear (Flavor down)\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear (Flavor: Flavor ...)\nTime for new flava in ya ear (here comes the flavor)\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear (Flavor in ya ear: boy)\n\nHa! The Mack is dope\nWith more hope than the Pope: but for M.C.'s more knots than rope\nI'd like to break it down down-breakin' forsaken\nLords of M.C.'s shakin' with this track that my man's makin'\nM.C.'s will run like a bomb threat\nI bet (what?) or better yet (huh?) make you sweat\nGettin' hotter than the sun get (yup!)\nCraig Mack is the flav that romps from here to Tibet (BOY!)\nI break all rules with my action\nThat the Mack sends to M.C.'s stop relaxin'\nThis brand new sheriff that's in town\n'S gettin' down: leavin' bodies buried in the ground (rest in peace)\nI set up rhymes for a decoy\nTo off a bad boy (Ooh!) Watch the M.C.'s I destroy and (BOY!)\n\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear (time for new flavor)\nTime for new flava in ya ear (fla-VOR!)\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear (time for the flav)\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear (boy: here comes the Mack)\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear (HA! wakin' up with some flavor!)\nTime for new flava in ya ear\nI'm kickin' brand new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear\n\n(Ha! boy)",

(back in the day) (when?) (back in the day)\n\nVerse two:\n\nI'm still back in the days: but now the year is '87\n'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high\nIn 7th grade: I hated school (wish it'd blow up)\nNo doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)\n\n\nBut let me finish this reminescin and tellin'\nBout when girls was bellin tight courderoys like for the boys\nBasket weaves: nike court airs: and footsie socks\nAnd eatin pickles: with tootsie pops\nAnd it don't stop: I'm glad 'cause when j.j. fad hit\nSupersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts\nOr: to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses\nOf hoochies: had poison airbrushes on they asses\nDudes: had on nike suits: and the pumas with\nThe fat laces: 'cause it was either that or k-swiss\nI miss those days: and so I pout like a grown jerk\nWishin all I had to do now: was finish homework\nIt's true: you don't realize really what you got till it's gone\nAnd I'm not: gonna sing another sad song: but\nSometimes I do sit and reminesce then\nThink about the years I was raised: back in the days\n\n\n(And everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(And everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(And everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(What?) (back in the day) (when?) (back in the day)\n\nVerse three:\n\nWell: it's the niggerole: I figure that now I'm all grown up\nBecause I'm eighteen years old: and guess you could say I'm holdin'\nDown a steady job and crew steady mobbin\nYou steady bobbin your head and I'm paid: so I got it made\nBut: didn't always have clout: used to live in south central l.a.\nThat's where I stayed and figured a way out\nI gave it all I had so for what it's worth\nI went: from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first\nSo (ahmad and the jones' is on our way up)\nYup: we said that we was gonna make it since a kid\nAnd we finally did: but\nSometimes I still sit and reminesce: then\nThink about the years I was raised: back in the days\n\n\n(And everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(And everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(And everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(What?)
