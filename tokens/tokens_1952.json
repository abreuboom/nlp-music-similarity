Now: now think for a moment! Think!\nIf the sheep were lost: and you couldn't find them:\nYou'd have to leave them alone: wouldn't you?\nSo: \"Leave them alone\". \"Leave them alone\".\nIt's in the book!\n\n\"Leave them alone and they\": they being the sheep: \"they will come\nHome\".\nAh yes: they'll come home.\nOh: there'll be a brighter day tomorrow: they will come home!\nIt's in the book.\n\n\"They will come home?a-waggin' their tails Good for everything in the home:\nAnd the secret was in the scrubbing:\nIt wouldn't suds and couldn't foam.\n\nThen let us sing right out of grandma's: of grandma's lye soap\nUsed for - for everything: everything on the place:\nFor pots and kettles: the dirty dishes: and for your hands and for\nYour face.\n\nSo we'll now sing the second verse.\nLet's get it with great exuberance: let's live it up.\nIt's not raining inside tonight.\nEveryone: let's have a happy time.\nAre we ready? All together: the second verse.\n\nLittle Herman and brother Thurman\nHad an aversion to washing their ears\nGrandma scrubbed them with the lye soap.\nAnd they haven't heard a word in years.\n\nThen let us sing right out of grandma's: of grandma's lye soap.\nSing all out: all over the place.\nThe pots and kettles: the dirty dishes: and also hands and also f?\n(Clapping fades)\n\nWell: let's sing what's left of the last verse.\nLet's have a happy time: everyone.\nThe last verse: al-l-l-l together.\nEv-v-v-very one!\n\nMm-m-m-m. Thank you kindly: kindly:\nM-m-mrs. O'Malley: out in the valley:\nSuffered from Ulcers: I understand.\nShe swallowed a cake of grandma's lye soap:\nHas the cleanest ulcers in the land.\n\nThen let us sing right out of grandma's: of grandma's lye soap.\nSing right out. All over the place.\nThe pots and - the pots and pans: oh dirty dishes:\nAnd the hands...",
