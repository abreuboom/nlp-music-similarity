My outfit's ridiculous\nIn the club lookin' so conspicuous\nAnd Rowl!  These women all on the prowl\nIf you hold the head steady: I'm a milk the cow\n\nForget about the game: I'm a spit the truth\nI won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits\nSo gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes\nThen bend over to the front and touch your toes\n\nI left the Jag and I took the Rolls\nIf they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol\nHow you like me now\nWhen my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand\n\nLet's drink: you the one to please\nLudacris feel cups like double D's\nMe and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead\nWe want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say\n\n\nYeah yeah: shawty got down and said come and get me\nYeah yeah: I got so caught up I forgot she told me\nYeah yeah: her and my girl used be the best of homies\nYeah yeah: next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming\nYeah: yeah yeah: yeah yeah: yeaah\nYeah: yeah yeah: yeah yeah: yeaah\n\n\nTake that and rewind it back\nLil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go\nTake that and rewind it back\nUsher got the voice to make ya booty go\nTake that and rewind it back\nLudacris got the flow to make ya booty go\nTake that and rewind it back\nLil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go",

        "Lyrics": "Teen drinking is very bad\nYo I got a fake ID though\nYeah: yeah: yeah: yo: 2 step with me: 2 step with me\n\n1: here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4\nEverybody drunk out on the dance floor\nBaby girl ass jiggle like she want more\nLike she a groupie and I ain't even on tour\nMaybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore\nOr maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores\nBottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score\nIf not I gotta move on to the next whore:\nHere comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1\nHomeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun\nWhen it come to poppin' we do shit for fun\nYou ain't got one nigga you betta run\nNow I'm in the back gettin' head from my hunz\nWhile she goin' down I'm breakin down what I done\nShe smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun\nBitch give it back now you don't get none\n\nNow everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\n\nNow everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\n\nNow everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\n\nNow everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\n\n2: here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5\nNow I'm lookin' at shorty right in the eyes\nCouple seconds passed now I'm lookin' at her thighs\nWhile she tellin' me how much she hate her guy\nSaid she got a kid but she got her tubes tied\nIf you 21 girl that's all right\nI wonder if a shake comin' with them fries\nIf so baby can I get 'em super sized\nHere comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2\nShe started feelin' on my johnson right out the blue\nGirl you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool\nBut instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2\nHer eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels\nExpression on her face like she ain't got a clue\nThen she told me she don't run with a crew\nYou know how I do but I guess one gotta do\n\nNow everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\n\n3: here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6\nSelf explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich\nThis single man ain't tryna get hitched\nLiquor wasted on me man son of a bitch\nBrushed it all off now I'm back to gettin' lit\nGoose and orange juice man this some good ish\nHomeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick\nNow he on the sideline starin' at my clique\nHere comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3\nHands in the air if you cats drunk as me\nClub on the set Kwon cut out them trees\nDude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P.\n\nNow everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\n\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy\nEverybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy",

        "Lyrics": "(J/Weav)\nOoh: yeah yeah\nDTP: how we do\nCall you and you can call me\nWhatever you wanna do baby\n\n(Chorus - J/Weav & (Chingy):)\n(You: could: roll: wit: me)\nGimme a call if you wanna come roll with me\n(If you was my baby)\nI'm only one call away\n(You: could: roll: wit: me)\nGimme a call if you wanna come roll with me\n(If you was my lady)\nI'm only one call away (2x)\n\n(Chingy)\nIt was weird how we met: huh\nShe was wit her mom in Bank America\nI'm wit my son cashin the check\nSo I asked outta respect (uh)\nWould she like to explore the world up high\nWe can fly in my jet\nHer reply was Yes: can I ask you somethin'?\nI seen it in her eye: mama lookin' like all I wanted was sex\nThen moved to the next (that ain't true) but it was something\nAbout this girl's style that make me feel no regrets\nWe started off casual; walks through the park\nCandle light dinners by dark: I'm thinkin' smart (smart)\nAfraid she might think I'm in a rush\nTo touch: crush and be up: but baby I ain't on that stuff\nDropped her off and told her call me up: we can talk\nConversate about political subjects whatever's thought\nSo I zoomed off: lookin' by and my phone rang\nIt was her in the shower: (she said) she said I couldn't do without ya\nThen I said...\n\n(Chingy)\nThe next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playing ball\nHere she comes wit her friends they posted up on the wall\nNow I'm showing off: tryna dunk tryna dribble break fast\nThrough the middle just to see her smile and giggle\nGame over I approched her wit a kiss on the cheek\nThe homeboys lookin' at me sayin' Lil Howard you weak\nBut you know how that go: what I got they want\nWhat I got I flaunt: never mess wit it: please don't\nTold her I'm going home she asked can she go too\nI'm like Yeah boo: I can't see me without you\nGot thurr: I took a shower jumped out she in the bed\nWith a see-through thong said I looked at her and said...\n\n(Chingy)\nGirl recognize game: before game recognize you\nYou're dealin' wit a player: true\nNow whatchu wanna do?\nWe can kick it and go puff on a bluuunt\nOh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of Hen' then we can get druuunk\nIt's up to you: I'm the man but baby just let me know\n'Cause if you got an attitude I could treat you just like a hoe\nGet to rollin' wit me baby: hop in there's enough room\nWe can gaze at the stars that shine like the moon\nGimme a chance to show ya: and a chance to know ya\nJust be true: and there's nothing I won't do: for ya\nSome women like to play it foul (foul)\nBut them the kind I put in the place of a child (child)\nDon't worry be happy and smile and...\n\n(J/Weav)\nDTP: how we do\nGimme a call if you wanna ball",

Young and restless\nWhere restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace\nAnd next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus\nSomebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is\nI walk through the valley of the Chi where death is\nTop floor the view alone will leave you breathless\nTry to catch it: it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives: yeah: yeah: now check the method\nThey be askin' us questions: harass and arrest us\nSayin' \"We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast\"\nHuh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?\nWe ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases\nA trunk full of coke: rental car from Avis\nMy mama used to say only Jesus can save us\nWell mama I know I act a fool\nBut I'll be gone till November: I got packs to move: I hope\n\nKanye West:\n(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down \n(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong\n(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long\n(I want Jesus)\n\n(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down \n(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong\n(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long\n(I want Jesus)\n\nKanye West and John Legend:\nUh: to the hustlers: killers: murderers: drug dealers: even the scrippers (Jesus walks for them)\nTo the victims of welfare for we livin' in Hell here: hell yeah (Jesus walks for them)\nNow: hear ye: hear ye: want to see thee more clearly\nI know he hear me when my feet get weary\n'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct\nWe rappers is role models: we rap: we don't think\nI ain't here to argue about his facial features\nOr here to convert atheists into believers\nI'm just tryna say the way school need teachers\nThe way Kathie Lee needed Regis: that's the way I need Jesus\nSo here go my single dog: radio needs this\nThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus\nThat means guns: sex: lies: videotape\nBut if I talk about God my record won't get played: huh?\nWell if this take away from my spins\nWhich'll probably take away from my ends\nThen I hope this take away from my sins\nAnd bring the day that I'm dreamin' about\nNext time I'm in the club: everybody screamin' out\n\nKanye West:\n(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down\n(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now",

The club and the moon is full\nAnd I'm lookin' for a thick: young lady to pull\nOne sure shot way to get 'em outta them pants\nTake note to the brand new dance: like dis\n\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nHell yeah!

        "Lyrics": "Syleena Johnson and Kanye West:\nOh when it all: it all falls down (Yeah: this the real one baby)\nI'm tellin' you all: it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up)\nOh when it all: it all falls down (Southside: southside: we gon' set this party off right)\nI'm telling you all: it all falls down (Westside: westside: we 'gon set this party off right)\nOh when it all\n\nKanye West:\nMan I promise: she's so self-conscious\nShe has no idea what she's doing in college\nThat major that she majored in don't make no money\nBut she won't drop out: her parents will look at her funny\nNow: tell me that ain't insecure\nThe concept of school seems so secure\nSophomore: three yurrs: ain't picked a career\nShe like: \"Fuck it: I'll just stay down here and do hair\"\n'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs\n'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care\nShe's so precious with the peer pressure\nCouldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis\nShe had hair so long that it looked like weave\nThen she cut it all off: now she look like Eve\nAnd she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe\nSingle black female addicted to retail and well\n\nSyleena Johnson and Kanye West:\nOh when it all: it all falls down\n(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)\nI'm tellin' you all: it all falls down (C'mon: c'mon)\n(And when it falls down) Oh when it all\n\nKanye West:\nMan I promise: I'm so self-conscious\nThat's why you always see me with at least one of my watches\nRollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy\nI can't even pronounce nothing: pass that ver-say-see\nThen I spent four-hundred bucks on this\nJust to be like: \"Nigga you ain't up on this\"\nAnd I can't even go to the grocery store\nWithout some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team\nIt seems we living the American dream\nBut the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem\nThe prettiest people do the ugliest things\nFor the road to riches and diamond rings\nWe shine because they hate us: floss 'cause they degrade us\nWe trying to buy back our forty acres\nAnd for that paper: look how low we a stoop\nEven if you in a Benz: you still a nigga in a coupe\n\nSyleena Johnson and Kanye West:\nOh when it all: it all falls down (C'mon: c'mon)\n(And when it falls down who you gonna call now?)\nI'm tellin' you all: it all falls down (C'mon: c'mon)\n(And when it falls down) Oh when it all\n\nKanye West:\nI say fuck the police: that's how I treat 'em\nWe buy our way out of jail: but we can't buy freedom\nWe-a buy a lot of clothes: but we don't really need 'em\nThings we buy to cover up what's inside\n'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth\nThat's why shorties holler: \"Where the ballers at?\"\nDrug dealer buy Jordans: crackhead buy crack\nAnd a white man get paid off of all of that\nBut I ain't even gonna act holier than thou\n'Cause fuck it: I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou\nBefore I had a house and I'd do it again\n'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz\nI want to act ballerific like it's all terrific\nI got a couple past due bills: I won't get specific\nI got a problem with spendin' before I get it\nWe all self-conscious: I'm just the first to admit it\n\nSyleena Johnson and Kanye West:\nOh when it all: it all falls down (Yeah: c'mon: c'mon)\n(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)\nI'm tellin' you all: it all falls down (C'mon: c'mon\n(And when it falls down)\n\nOh when it all: it all falls down (Southside: southside: we gon' set this party off right)\nI'm telling you all: it all falls down (Westside: westside: we gon' set this party off right)\nOh when it all: it all falls down (Chi-Town: Chi-Town: we gon' show 'em how we get down)\nI'm tellin' you all: it all falls down (Now Syleena: you just like a safe belt: you saved my life)\nOh when it all: it all falls down\nI'm tellin' you all: it all falls down\n\nDeRay Davis:\nI's can't keep working like this\nThis grave shift is like a slave shift",

Soaking wet\nShake it like a salt shaker\n\nPopping till you percolate\nFirst booty-on-booty: no time to wait\nMake it work: with your wet t-shirt\nBitch you gotta shake it till your calve muscles hurt\nSadie heels on your feet: strap around your ankles\nJegga jegga jegga\nCall that bitch Bojangles\nJuicy like fruit or douche like coup Deville\nLucy get loose on the goose for real\nFive dollars get your ass a table dance\nIf you got 10 then bring a friend\nHo shake your ass till the song then\nIf you ain't gon dance: well go on: then!\nWe ain't no boys: we grown men\nIf you ain't gonna dance: well don't then!\nWhy you gonna waste a nigga's song: then?\nSit your ass down doing nothing?\n\nShawty crunk on the floor wide open\nSkeet so much they call her Billy Ocean\nRoll like an 18-wheeler\nThat ho fine: but this ho killer\nShe's leaking! Soaking wet\nShe leaking! Soaking wet\nShake it like a salt shaker\n\nFace the wall shawty: put your hands on it\nBounce that ass up & down; make a nigga want it\nFace the wall shawty: put your hands on it\nBounce that ass up & down; make a nigga want it\nRoll that ass round & round like a motherfucking wheel\nShake that shit: this ain't no motherfuckin drill!\nRoll that ass round & round like a motherfucking wheel\nShake that shit this ain't no motherfucking drill!\nGet crunk with: get loose with it\nLike Short said: let Bruce Bruce hit it!\nGet crunk with it: get loose with it\nLike Short said: let Bruce Bruce hit it\nShake that ass real fast then stop\nShake that ass real fast then stop\nShake that ass real fast then drop\nShake that ass real fast then drop\n\nShawty crunk on the floor wide open\nSkeet so much they call her Billy Ocean\nRoll like an 18-wheeler\nThat ho fine: but this ho killer\nShe's leaking! Soaking wet\nShe leaking! Soaking wet\nShake it like a salt shaker\n\nShake it like a dollar: 5: or 10\nBut what would you do for a twenty twen?\nGet on the stage shake that ass: then\nGet on the pole do a backbend\nI like that! Do it again!\nHere's another 10 bitch: do it again\nWork it like a game that you playing to win\nMake that pussy fart for the Ying Yang Twins\n\n16 bitches in thongs in 1 club\nThe home of the 5th: redbones and big butts\nGame spittin' bitches splitting all on the floor\nHornified: can't deny: certified pro\nOn the pole upside down (This shit for real!)\n69: plenty of times to pay a bill\nBy day she's a clerk: by night she turn stripper\nYou're not even dating\nYou just trying so you can tip her!",

        "Lyrics": "Sick and tired of this world\nThere's no more air\nTripping over myself: going nowhere\nWaiting: suffocating: no direction\nI took a dive and\n\nOn the way down\nI saw you: and you saved me from myself\nAnd I won't forget the way you loved me\nAnd on the way down\nI almost fell right through\nBut I held on to you\n\nBeen wondering why it's only me\nHave you always been inside waiting to breathe\nIt's all right: sunlight on my face\nI wake up and yet: I'm alive 'cause\n\nOn the way down\nI saw you: and you saved me from myself\nAnd I won't forget the way you loved me\nAnd on the way down\nI almost fell right through\nBut I held on to you\n\nI was so afraid of going under\nBut now: the weight of the world\nFeels like nothing: no nothing\n(Down: down: down)\nYou're all I wanted\n(Down: down: down)\nYou're all I needed\n(Down: down: down)\nYou're all I wanted\nYou're all I needed\n\nAnd I won't forget the way you loved me\nAll that I wanted: all that I needed now\n\nOn the way down\nI saw you: and you saved me from myself\nAnd I won't forget the way you loved me\nAnd on the way down\nI almost fell right through\nBut I held on to you",
