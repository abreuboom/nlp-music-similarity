(round and around and around and around)\nBaby: round and round we go.\nDon't you know: don't you know?\nRound and round we go:\nWhere we stop: nobody knows.\nThe band is swinging on the stand:\nWe're moving in: we're moving out.\nThen we'll step back now and end this dance with a shout:\nSo work out!\n\nNow when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it!\nYeah: let's shout: baby: let's shout! (shout baby shout)\nHoney: let's shout!\nBaby: let's shout!\nYeah: shout and turn it out: baby!\nLet's shout: let's shout: shout all night long!\nI gotta have it just one more time:\nNow here we go!\nRound and round we go:\nNow work out: work out: work all night long!\nWork out: baby!\nWork out woman!\nShout and turn the joint out!\nWork out: work out: baby: baby...",
