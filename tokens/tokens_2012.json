What do I stand for?\nMost nights: I don't know anymore\n\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah oh oh\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah oh oh\n\nThis is it: boys: this is war\nWhat are we waiting for?\nWhy don't we break the rules already?\n\nI was never one to believe the hype\nSave that for the black and white\nI try twice as hard and I'm half as liked\nBut here they come again to jack my style\n\nAnd that's alright\nI found a martyr in my bed tonight\nShe stops my bones from wondering just who I am: who I am: who I am\nOh: who am I? mmm: mmm\n\nWell: some nights: I wish that this all would end\n'Cause I could use some friends for a change\nAnd some nights: I'm scared you'll forget me again\nSome nights: I always win: I always win\n\nBut I still wake up: I still see your ghost\nOh Lord: I'm still not sure what I stand for: oh\nWhat do I stand for? What do I stand for?\nMost nights: I don't know (come on)\n\nSo this is it? I sold my soul for this?\nWashed my hands of that for this?\nI miss my mom and dad for this?\n\nNo. When I see stars: when I see: when I see stars: that's all they are\nWhen I hear songs: they sound like a swan: so come on\nOh: come on\nOh: come on\nOh: come on\n\nWell: this is it guys: that is all\nFive minutes in and I'm bored again\nTen years of this: I'm not sure if anybody understands\n\nThis one is not for the folks at home\nSorry to leave: mom: I had to go\nWho the fuck wants to die alone\nAll dried up in the desert sun?\n\nMy heart is breaking for my sister\nAnd the con that she call \"love\"\nBut when I look into my nephew's eyes\nMan: you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from\n\nSome terrible nights\nAhh: ahh\nAhh: ahh\n\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah: oh oh\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah: oh oh\n\nThe other night: you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me\nI called you up: but we'd both agree\n\nIt's for the best you didn't listen\nIt's for the best we get our distance: oh\nIt's for the best you didn't listen\nIt's for the best we get our distance: oh",

How you feel? How you feel?\n25 sittin' on 25 mil\nI'm in the building and I'm feeling myself\nRest in peace Mac Dre: imma do it for the Bay\n\nOkay: getting paid: we'll holler whenever that stop\nMy team good: we don't really need a mascot\nTell Tune: \"Light one: pass it like a relay.\"\nYMCMB: you niggas more YMCA\n\nMe: Franny: and Mally Mall at the crib-o\nShout goes out to Niko: J: and Chubbs: shouts to Gibbo\nWe got Santa Margherita by the liter\nShe know even if I'm fucking with her: I don't really need her\n\nThat's how you feel: man? That's really how you feel?\n'Cause the pimpin' ice cold: all these bitches wanna chill\nI mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will\nI can almost guarantee she know the deal: real nigga: what's up?\n\nNow she want a photo: you already know though\nYou only live once: that's the motto nigga: YOLO\nAnd we 'bout it every day: every day: every day\nLike we sittin' on the bench: nigga: we don't really play\nEvery day: every day: fuck what anybody say\nCan't seem 'em cause the money in the way: real nigga: what's up?\n\nOne... time? Fuck one time\nI'm calling niggas out like the umpire\nSeven... grams in the blunt\nAlmost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt\n\nIt's Eastside: we in this bitch\nWish a nigga would: like a tree in this bitch\nAnd if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch\nThat's my MO: add a B to that shit\n\nI'm fucked up: torn down\nI'm twisted: door knob\nTalk stupid? Off with your head!\nNigga money talks: and Mr. Ed\n\nI'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun\nEnergizer bunny\nFunny how honey ain't sweet like sugar\nAin't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers\n\nI tongue kiss her other tongue\nSkeet skeet skeet: water gun\nOh my God: Becky: look at her butt! Tunechi\n\nNow she want a photo: you already know: though\nYou only live once: that's the motto nigga: YOLO\nAnd we 'bout it every day: every day: every day\nLike we sittin' on the bench: nigga: we don't really play\nEvery day: every day: fuck what anybody say\nCan't seem 'em cause the money in the way: real nigga: what's up?\n\nReal nigga: what's up?\n\nNow she want a photo: you already know: though\nYou only live once: that's the motto nigga: YOLO\nAnd we 'bout it every day: every day: every day\nLike we sittin' on the bench: nigga: we don't really play\nEvery day: every day: fuck what anybody say\nCan't seem 'em cause the money in the way: real nigga: what's up?",

Please: don't be so ashamed\nI've had mine: you've had yours: we both know\nWe know\n\nThey won't get you like I will\nMy only wish is I die real\n'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal\nAnd you can't sleep thinking that he lies still\n\nSo you cry still: tears all in the pillowcase\nBig girls all get a little taste (aww)\nPushing me away so I give her space (Aww)\nDealing with a heart that I didn't break\n\nI'll be there for you: I will care for you\nI keep thinking you just don't know\nTrying to run from that: say you done with that\nOn your face: girl it just don't show\n\nWhen you're ready: just say you're ready\nWhen all the baggage just ain't as heavy\nAnd the party's over: just don't forget me\nWe'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...\n\nYou won't ever have to worry\nYou won't ever have to hide\nAnd you've seen all my mistakes\nSo look me in my eyes\n\n(Rihanna)\n'Cause if you let me: here's what I'll do:\nI'll take care of you...\nI've loved and I've lost\n\n(Drake)\nIt's my birthday: I'll get high if I want to\nCan't deny that I want you: but I'll lie if I have to\n'Cause you don't say you love me\nTo your friends: when they ask you\nEven though we both know that you do\nYou do\n\nOne time: been in love one time\nYou and all your girls in the club one time\nAll so convinced that you're following your heart\n'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes\n\nWe all have our nights though: don't be so ashamed\nI've had mine: you've had yours: we both know\nWe know\n\nYou hate being alone: well you ain't the only one\nYou hate the fact: that you bought the dream: when they sold you one\nYou love your friends: but somebody should've told you something\nTo save you... instead they say:\n\nDon't tell me: I don't care\nIf you hurt: I won't tell you\nYou don't care if you're true\n\nDon't tell me: I don't care\nIf you hurt: I won't tell you\nYou don't care if you're true\n\n(Rihanna)\nI know you've been hurt\nBy someone else\nI can tell by the way you carry yourself\nIf you let me: here's what I'll do:\nI'll take care of you...\nI've loved and I've lost",

Like: ever.\n\nNo: we are never ever ever getting back together\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\nYou go talk to your friends: talk to my friends: talk to me\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\n\nWe: ooh: ooh: getting back together\nWe: ooh: oh: getting back together\nYou go talk to your friends: talk to my friends: talk to me\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together",

(What? what?)\nAnd now you're doing them with her (With her!)\nRemember all the things that you and I did first?\nYou got me: got me like this (like this)\n\nAnd now you're taking her to every restaurant (Yeah: yeah)\nAnd everywhere we went: come on\nAnd now you're taking her to every restaurant\nYou got me: got me like this\n\nBoy: you can say anything you want\nI don't give a shit: no one else can have ya\nI want you back: I want you back\nWant-want you: want you back\n\nI broke it off thinking you'd be crying\nNow I feel like shit looking at you flying\nI want you back: I want you back\nWant-want you: want you back\n\nOoh: I thought you'd still be mine\nWhen I kissed you goodbye: oh-oh: oh-oh\nOoh: and you might be with her\nBut I still had you first: (Let's go) oh-oh: oh-oh (Astro)\n\nWe used to be: but now there's a separation between you and me\nBaby I'm moving on to another girl that understands me more\nDated her in front your place so you can see it all\n\nI remember the times when we used to bond\nBut I never realized that you wanted to be mine\nSo I gave her the ring instead of you: nickname too\nI can tell you're upset because it ain't you\n\nMet a new girl and I gave her my heart\nNot noticing that you wanted me from the very start\nYou want me back? We can just be friends\nOr try this thing all over again\n\n(Oh) Boy: you can say anything you want\nI don't give a shit: no one else can have ya\nI want you back: I want you back\nWant-want you: want you back\n\nI broke it off thinking you'd be crying\nNow I feel like shit looking at you flying\nI want you back: I want you back\nWant-want you: want you back (I want you back)\n\nOoh (Let me know): I want you back: I want you back\nWant-want you: want you back (What: what) (Yeah) (Uh)\nI want you back: I want you back\nWant-want you: want you back\n\nJust sound like a helicopter",

Think about the stars in the sky?\nFunny how a melody sounds like a memory\nLike a soundtrack to a July Saturday night: Springsteen: Springsteen\n\nFunny how a melody sounds like a memory\nLike a soundtrack to a July Saturday night\nSpringsteen: Springsteen\nWhoa: Springsteen",

(turn it up)\nAnd crank it higher every time they told you to stop?\n\nAnd all I ask is that you don't get mad at me\nWhen you have to purchase mad D batteries\nAppreciate every mixtape your friends make\nYou never know: we come and go like on the interstate\n\nI think finally found a note to make you understand\nIf you can hear this: sing along and take me by the hands\nKeep me stuck inside your head: like your favorite tune\nAnd know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you\n\nMy heart's a stereo\nIt beats for you: so listen close\nHear my thoughts in every note\nO-oh\n\nMake me your radio\nAnd turn me up when you feel low\nThis melody was meant for you\nSo sing along to my stereo\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh: to my stereo\nOh oh oh oh: so sing along to my stereo\n\nI only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)\nBecause good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)\nI'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)\nThought love was dead: but now you're changing my mind (yeah: yeah c'mon!)\n\nMy heart's a stereo\nIt beats for you: so listen close\nHear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (oh: oh)\n\nMake me your radio\nAnd turn me up when you feel low\nThis melody was meant for you\nSo sing along to my stereo\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh: to my stereo\nOh oh oh oh: so sing along to my stereo\n\nIt's ya boy Travie\nGym Class Heroes: baby!\n\nSo sing along to my stereo\n\nYeah!",

No! No! God: no!)\nYou're my-you're my (friend?) friend\n(Friend: friend: friend: life-long)\nThank you for being my friend\n\nRed Solo cup\nI fill you up\nLet's have a party\nLet's have a party\n\nI love you: red Solo cup\nI lift you up\nProceed to party\nProceed to party",

        "Lyrics": "Couple guys in first class on a flight from New York to Los Angeles \nKinda making small talk: killin' time: flirtin' with the flight attendants \nThirty thousand feet above what would be Oklahoma \n\nJust a bunch of square corn fields and wheat farms: man it all looks the same \nMiles and miles of back roads and highways connecting little towns with funny names \nWho'd wanna live down there: in the middle of nowhere \n\nThey've never drove through Indiana \nMet the man who plowed that Earth \nPlanted that seed: busted his ass for you and me \nOr caught a harvest moon in Kansas \nThey'd understand why God made those fly over states \n\nI bet that mile haul in Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all \nJust like that flat bed cowboy stacking U.S. steel on a three day haul \nRoads and rails under their feet: yeah that sounds like a first class seat \n\nOn the plains of Oklahoma \nWith a windshield sunset in your eyes \n\nLike a watercolor painted sky \nYou'll think heaven's doors have opened \nYou'll understand why God made those fly over states \n\nTake a ride across the Badlands \nFeel that freedom on your face \nBreathe in all that open space \nAnd meet a girl from Amarillo\n\nYou'll understand why God made... \nYou might even wanna plant your stakes \nIn those fly over states \nYeah \n\nHave you ever been through Indiana \nOn the plains of Oklahoma \nTake a ride",
