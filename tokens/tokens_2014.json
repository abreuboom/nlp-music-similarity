Show 'em what?) what's really crazy\nYou should've known better than to mess with me: honey (It's all over with now)\nI'm gonna love ya: I'm gonna love ya: gonna love ya: gonna love ya\nLike a black widow: baby\n\n(Black-black widow: baby)\n\nIggy Azalea:\nI'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts\nJust to get you: I'm doing whatever works\nYou have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya\nThat will bring you to your knees: praise Jesus: hallelujah\nI'ma make you beg for it: plead for it\nTill you feel like you breathe for it\nTill you do any and everything for it\nI want you to fiend for it: wake up and dream for it\nTill it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it\nTill they have a cat scan that check on your mind and it's nothin' but me (on it: on it...)\nNow it's me time believe that\nIf it's yours when you want it: I wouldn't promise I need that\nTill I'm everywhere that you be at\nI can't fall back: or quit it\n'Cause this here's a fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shh\n\nRita Ora (Iggy Azalea):\nYou used to be thirsty for me (Right)\nBut now you wanna be set free\nThis is the web: web that you weave\nSo baby now rest in peace\n\n(It's all over with now)\n\nI'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)\nAnd I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what?

        "Lyrics": "We\nWe don't have to worry about nothing\n'Cause we got the fire\nAnd we're burning one hell of a something\nThey\nThey're gonna see us from outer space: outer space\nLight it up\nLike we're the stars of the human race: human race\n\nWhen the light's turning down\nThey don't know what they heard\nStrike the match: play it loud\nGiving love to the world\nWe'll be raising our hands\nShining up to the sky\n'Cause we got the fire: fire: fire\nYeah: we got the fire: fire: fire\n\nAnd we gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nGonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\n\nWe don't wanna leave\nNo: we just gonna be right now: right now\nAnd what we see is everybody's on the floor\nActing crazy: getting loco till the light's out\nMusic's on: I'm waking up\nWe start the fire: then we burn it up\nAnd it's over now: we got the love\nAnd there's no sleeping now: no sleeping now\n\nWhen the light's turning down\nThey don't know what they heard\nStrike the match: play it loud\nGiving love to the world\nWe'll be raising our hands\nShining up to the sky\n'Cause we got the fire: fire: fire\nYeah: we got the fire: fire: fire\n\nAnd we gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nGonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\n\nWhen the light's turning down\nThey don't know what they heard\nStrike the match: play it loud\nGiving love to the world\n\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nBurn: burn: burn: burn: burn: burn\n\nWe can light it up: up: up\nSo they can't put it out: out: out\nWe can light it up: up: up\nSo they can't put it out: out: out\n\nWe can light it up: up: up\nSo they can't put it out: out: out\nWe can light it up: up: up\nSo they can't put it out: out: out\n\nWhen the light's turning down\nThey don't know what they heard\nStrike the match: play it loud\nGiving love to the world\nWe'll be raising our hands\nShining up to the sky\n'Cause we got the fire: fire: fire\nYeah: we got the fire: fire: fire\n\nAnd we gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nGonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\nWe gonna let it burn: burn: burn: burn\n\nWhen the light's turning down\nThey don't know what they heard\nStrike the match: play it loud\nGiving love to the world\nWe'll be raising our hands\nShining up to the sky\n'Cause we got the fire: fire: fire\nYeah: we got the fire: fire: fire\n\nAnd we gonna let it burn",

        "Lyrics": "Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow\nAnd every tomorrow: maybe you'll let me borrow your heart\nAnd is it too much to ask for every Sunday\nIf I were radical and every other day to start\n\nI know people make promises all the time\nThen they turn right around and break them\nWhen someone cuts your heart open with a knife: while you beating\nBut I could be that guy to heal it over time\nAnd I won't stop until you believe it\n'Cause baby you're worth it\n\nSo don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me\n'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true: with me\nSpend all your time and your money just find out my love was free\nSo don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\nIt's not a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\n\nNow how about I'd be the last voice you hear at night?\nAnd every other night for the rest of the nights that there are\nEvery morning I just wanna see you staring back at me\n'Cause I know that's a good place to start\n\nI know people make promises all the time\nThen they turn right around and break them\nWhen someone cuts your heart open with a knife: while you beating\nDon't you know I could be that guy to heal it over time\nAnd I won't stop until you believe it\n'Cause baby you're worth it\n\nSo don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me\n'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true: with me\nSpend all your time and your money just find out my love was free\nSo don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\nIt's not a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\nIt's not a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\nNot such a bad thing to fall in love with me\n\nNo I won't feel your mind: broken promises: and waste of time\nAnd if you fall: you'll always land right in these arms\nThese arms of mine\n\nSo don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me\n'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true: with me\nSpend all your time and your money just find out my love was free\nSo don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\nIt's not a bad thing to fall in love with me: me\nNot such a bad thing to fall in love with me\n\nIf I had a pair of wings\nI'd pick you up and fly you far away from here\nAnd you'd put your worries upon my shoulders: my dear\nNow I know I can't save you\nFrom the troubles of the world\nAnd this sounds like such a silly thing\nBut if I could I'd fly you away\nOn a big old pair of wings\n\nAnd if I had a pair of wings\nI'd pick you up and fly you far away from here\nAnd we'd fly so high up in the sky\nWhere the stars are so clear\nAnd then I could save you\nFrom the troubles of the world\nAnd all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring\nAnd there we are: you and me\nFlying on a big old pair of wings\n\nWe keep getting older: the world keeps getting colder\nTell me when did we lose our way?\nIt's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days\nBut if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for\nThere's only one thing that'll do\nI'd fly away on this pair of wings with you\nIf I had a pair of wings\nI'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear\nThen you could put your worries upon my shoulders: my dear\nAnd I know I can't save you\nFrom the troubles of the world\nI know this sounds like such a silly thing\nBut if I could I'd fly you away\nOn a big old pair of wings\n\nNow if I had a pair of wings\nI'd pick you up and fly you far away from here\nAnd I could stay right by your side and keep you so near\nAnd then I could save you form the troubles of the world\nAnd all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring\nAnd there we are: you and me\nFlying on a big old pair of wings\n\nWe keep getting older: the world keeps getting colder\nTell me when did we lose our way?\nIt's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days\nAnd if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for\nThere's only one thing that'll do\nI'd fly away on this pair of wings with you\nAnd if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for\nThere's only one thing that'll do\nI'd fly away on this pair of wings with you\nI said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for\nThere's only one thing that'll do\nI'd fly away on this pair of wings with you",

        "Lyrics": "I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath\nScared to rock the boat and make a mess\nSo I sat quietly\nAgreed politely\n\nI guess that I forgot I had a choice\nI let you push me past the breaking point\nI stood for nothing\nSo I fell for everything\n\nYou held me down: but I got up\nAlready brushing off the dust\nYou hear my voice: you hear that sound\nLike thunder: gonna shake the ground\n\nYou held me down: but I got up\nGet ready 'cause I've had enough\nI see it all: I see it now\n\nI got the eye of the tiger: a fighter\nDancin' through the fire\n'Cause I am the champion\nAnd you're gonna hear me roar\n\nLouder: louder than the lion\n'Cause I am the champion\nAnd you're gonna hear me roar\n\n... oh-oh-oh-ohh\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nYou're gonna hear me roar\n\nNow I'm floatin' like a butterfly\nStinging like a bee: I earned my stripes\nI went from zero\nTo my own hero\n\nYou held me down: but I got up\nAlready brushing off the dust\nYou hear my voice: you hear that sound\nLike thunder: gonna shake the ground\n\nYou held me down: but I got up\nGet ready 'cause I've had enough\nI see it all: I see it now\n\nI got the eye of the tiger: a fighter\nDancin' through the fire\n'Cause I am the champion\nAnd you're gonna hear me roar\n\nLouder: louder than the lion\n'Cause I am the champion\nAnd you're gonna hear me roar\n\n... oh-oh-oh-ohh\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nYou're gonna hear me roar\n\n... oh-oh-oh-ohh (hey)\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (you'll hear me roar)\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nYou're gonna hear me roar\n\nRoar: oh: roar: oh: roar\n\nI got the eye of the tiger: a fighter (I got the eye of the tiger)\nDancin' through the fire (dancin' through the fire)\n'Cause I am the champion (yeah)\nAnd you're gonna hear me roar\n\nLouder: louder than the lion (roar louder)\n'Cause I am the champion\nAnd you're gonna hear me roar (you're gonna hear me roar)\n\n... oh-oh-oh-ohh\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (yeah)\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh \nYou're gonna hear me roar (roar)\n\n... oh-oh-oh-ohh\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh (you'll hear me roar)\nOhh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nYou're gonna hear me roar (hear me roar)",

        "Lyrics": "I met this girl late last year\nShe said \"Don't you worry if I disappear\"\nI told her \"I'm not really looking for another mistake\"\nI called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\nBut then I jumped right in a week later: returned\nI reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\nBut I gave her my time for two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\nI went away four months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me \"I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around ten\nBaby: bring the lemon and a bottle of gin\nWe'll be in between the sheets till the late AM\"\nBaby: if you wanted me then should have just said: she's singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe\n\nFor a couple weeks I only wanna see her\nWe drink away the days with a takeaway pizza\nBefore a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha: all over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep: I guess that I don't want to either\nBut me and her: we make money the same way\nFour cities: two planes: the same day\nAnd those shows have never been what it's about\nBut maybe we'll go together and just figure it out\nI'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch\nBut we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now\nWish I'd have written it down: the way that things played out\nBut she was kissing him: how? I was confused about\nShe should figure it out: while I'm sat here singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe\n\n*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door\nI don't even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder: but I already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didn't need to take him to bed: that's all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex: of course\nIt's not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun: and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realized what you wanted\nIt's a bit too much: too late if I'm honest\nAll this time: God knows I'm singing\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don't wanna know that: babe\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that: babe",

I'm radioactive: radioactive\n\nI raise my flag: dye my clothes\nIt's a revolution: I suppose\nWe're painted red to fit right in: whoa\n\nI'm breaking in and shaping up\nThen checking out on the prison bus\nThis is it: the apocalypse: whoa\n\nI'm waking up: I feel it in my bones\nEnough to make my system blow\nWelcome to the new age: to the new age\nWelcome to the new age: to the new age\n\nWhoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive: radioactive\nWhoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive: radioactive\n\nAll systems go: the sun hasn't died\nDeep in my bones: straight from inside\n\nI'm waking up: I feel it in my bones\nEnough to make my system blow\nWelcome to the new age: to the new age\nWelcome to the new age: to the new age\n\nWhoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive: radioactive\nWhoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive: radioactive",

Shout out Capone and Noreaga\nWe can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later\nDiamonds in my Rollie face: cannot be exfoliated\nThey think I'm associated: I'm the one that orchestrated\nYayo get her ass whipped: whip that ass like horses racin'\nAin't 'bout what you walk away from: it's 'bout what you walk away with\nDead Presidents: them coffins vacant: I must be doin' somethin'\n\nI'm the only one that get the job done\nI don't know a nigga that can cover for me\nYeah: got some game from my days\nSo she might say she love me\nShe don't love me like she say she love me\nBelieve me: believe me\nI'm that nigga: boy they love me in the streets\nI'm not tryna find nobody else to beat\nI'm the one they come to see because they all\nBelieve me\n\nHad to get it poppin' off the rip\nRich young nigga that ain't never had to trick\nSlim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick\nIf she get a job at DOA: I drop her off a tip\nI had to get it poppin' off the rip\nI'm the one they tell ya been reppin' in the 6\nCome into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?\nWe'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff\nWell damn... just be happy for the man\nNirvana: Coldplay: nigga got bands\nInk from the money got it all over my hands\nGoin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance\nV Live just took me for a cheque\n\"Drake you know I love you: you just took me outta debt\"\nYes right now you are lookin' at the best\nMothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that!\n\nMothafuck the rest\nWhen they jumped off the porch: I was stumblin' up the steps\nI'd give what I collect before I give up my connect\nIt'd be a cold day in Hell: icicles made of sweat\nOne finger... slidin' 'cross my neck\nNiggas know what that mean like they deaf\nNigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day\nOn the job and the bitch overslept\nTune stay humble: nigga I'm a king\nNeed a horn and a drumroll\nThey throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet: nigga\nI don't step on one rose\nI'm the only one that get the job done\nI don't know a nigga that can cover for me\nTape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach\nShe look like she got a bun in the oven from me\nPreheat... believe me\nAll you gotta do is pay me every week\nI had these bitches havin' babies every week\nI'm the nigga: see me skatin' in the streets\nGone",

I'm illegally going 120\nEasy weaving in and out of the traffic\nThey cannot catch me: I'm smashing\nI'm ducking bucking them out here\nI'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic: I am up in a classic\nNow I know what it's like under the city lights\nRiding into the night: driving over the bridge\nThe same one we walked across as kids\nKnew I'd have a whip but never one like this\nOld school: old school: Candy paint: two seater\nYeah: I'm from Seattle: There's hella Honda Civics\nI couldn't tell you about paint either\nBut I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours\nAnd roll on over to the dealer\nAnd I found the car I'm dreaming of: as I bargain with this geezer\nGot the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming\n\nHollis\nGot that off-black Cadillac: midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal: leaning back: taking my time\nI'm blowin' that roof off: letting in sky\nI shine: the city never looked so bright\n\nScHoolboy Q\nBackwoods and dope\nWhite hoes in the backseat snorting coke\nShe doing line after line like she's writing rhymes\nI had it hella my love: tryna blow her mind\nCadillac pimpin': my uncle was on\n14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone\nSendin' portions of his liquor: water in the Patr&#xF3;n\nRather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes\n(Fuckin' lottery homes)\nTires with the spokes on it and the vogues too\nMustard and mayonnaise: keeping the buns on 'em\nMy dogs hanging out the window\nYoung as whoosh: fuckin' like we ball\nTryna fuck 'em all: kill the fuckin' wimps\nSee what's poppin' at the mall: meet a bad bitch\nSlap her booty with my palms\nYou can smoke the pussy: I was tearing down the walls\nI'm motherfuckin' awe... some\nSwear these eyes tryna hypnotize\nGrip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs\nSee the lust stuck up in her eyes\nMaybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?\nGirl does she want it low?\nThis shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know\nSo we cruise for minutes: my nigga fuck the limit\nGot a window tinted for showing gangstas in it\nSlide till the gas is finished: Q\n\nHollis\nGot that off-black Cadillac: midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal: leaning back: taking my time\nI'm blowin' that roof off: letting in sky\nI shine: the city never looked so bright\n\nGot that off-black Cadillac: midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal: leaning back: taking my time\nI'm blowin' that roof off: letting in sky\nI shine: the city never looked so bright",
