I do\nBut I won't stop and falter\nAnd if we threw it all away\nThings can only get better\n\nWhoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh\n(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)\nWhoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh\n(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)\n\nTreating today as though it was\nThe last: the final show\nGet to sixty and feel no regret\nIt may take a little time\nA lonely path: an uphill climb\nSuccess or failure will not alter it\n\nAnd do you feel scared? I do\nBut I won't stop and falter\nAnd if we threw it all away\nThings can only get better\n\nWhoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh\n(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)\nWhoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh\n(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)\n\nAnd do you feel scared?

Ooh\n\nGuess you believed the world\nPlayed by your rules\nHere stands an experienced girl\nI ain't nobody's fool... bump you\n\nDon't speculate\nYou thought you had me covered: now boy\nI've got your bait\nBut you're bound to be my lover... oh\n\nWho's zooming who\nTake another look and tell me babe\nWho's zooming who: who's zoomin' who\nWho's zooming who\nThe fish jumped off the hook\nDidn't I babe...\nWho's zooming who\nYeah: yeah: oh\n\nWho's zooming who\nTake another look\nAnd tell me baby\nWho's zooming who\nWho's fooling who\nWho's zooming who\nWell the fish jumped off that hook didn't I babe\nWho's zooming who:\nOoh...\n\nYou think you're smooth\nAnd you can pick and choose\nWhen the time is right...\nJust look behind: you'll be surprised to find\nI'm gonna make you mine tonight\nOoh: yeah...\nOh: yeah...\n\nWho's zooming who\nTake another look and tell me babe\nWho's zooming who\nWell the fish jumped off the hook\nDidn't I boy...\nWho's zooming who\n\nTake another look and tell me babe\nWho's zooming who\nDidn't I: didn't I: didn't I... oh\nWho's zooming who\nTake another look and tell me baby\nWho's fooling who\nWho's zooming who\n\nTake another look and tell be babe\nWho's zooming who... yeah\nWho's zooming who\nFish in the sea but they ain't me\nWho's zooming who\nSure I'm right: yeah\n\nWho's zooming who\nTake another look and tell me boy\nWho's zooming who\nWho's zooming who\n\nYou will remember my name...\nI'm the one who beat you at your game\n\nWho's zooming who\nOh take another look and tell me sweet thing\nWho's zooming who\nWho's zooming: who's fooling\nWho's zooming: who's fooling\nWho's zooming who\nOoh: ooh boy\nWho's zooming who",
