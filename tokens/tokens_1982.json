        "Lyrics": "Oh yeah\nI'm in love with the other woman\nMy life was fine (Yes it was)\nTill she blew my mind\n\nAw shucks: I'm just the average guy\nI fooled around a little on the side\nNever thought it would amount to much\nNever met a girl who's love was so tough\nWho'd a thought a one night stand\nCould turn into such a hot romance\nMm: when she did it to me\nI slipped and fell in love\n\nI'm in love with the other woman\nMy life was fine (Yes it was)\nTill she blew my mind\n\nNow I know the rules of the games\nYou hit it once then break away clean\nI should have never gone back: I know\nBut I had to have just a little bit more\nMy friends laugh but that's alright\nI may be a fool but I know what I like\nNow I hate to have to cheat\nBut it feels better when I sneak\n\nI'm in love with the other woman\nMy life was fine (Yes it was)\nTill she blew my mind\nSomebody help me\nI'm in love with the other woman\nMy life was fine (Yes it was)\nTill she blew my mind\n\nOh this affair is unique\nAll my life I never met such a freak\nShe keeps me goin' strong for so long\nWhen I get home it's all gone\nMakes me wanna grab my guitar\nAnd play with it all night long\n\nI'm in love with the other woman\nMy life was fine (Yes it was)\nTill she blew my mind\n\nTell me: has anybody else out there\nEver fell in love with the other woman\nOh with the other woman\nSay I'm in love with the other woman\nWith the other woman: with the other woman\nI'm in love: sure 'nough in love",

        "Lyrics": "I never believed in things that I couldn't see\nI said if I can't feel it then how can it be\nNo: no magic could happen to me\nAnd then I saw you\n\nI couldn't believe it: you took my heart\nI couldn't retrieve it: said to myself\nWhat's it all about\nNow I know there can be no doubt\n\nYou can do magic\nYou can have anything that you desire\nMagic and you know\nYou're the one who can put out the fire\n\nYou know darn well\nWhen you cast your spell you will get your way\nWhen you hypnotize with your eyes\nA heart of stone can turn to clay\n\nAnd when the rain\nIs beating upon the window pane\nAnd when the night: it gets so cold\nWhen I can't sleep\n\nAgain you come to me\nI hold you tight and the rain disappears\nWho would believe it\nWith a word you dry my tears\n\nYou can do magic\nYou can have anything that you desire\nMagic and you know\nYou're the one who can put out the fire\n\nYou know darn well\nWhen you cast your spell you will get your way\nWhen you hypnotize with your eyes\nA heart of stone can turn to clay\n\nAnd if I wanted to\nI could never be free\nI never believed it was true\nBut now it's so clear to me\n\nYou can do magic\nYou can have anything that you desire\nMagic and you know\nYou're the one who can put out the fire\n\nYou know darn well\nWhen you cast your spell you will get your way\nWhen you hypnotize with your eyes\nA heart of stone can turn to clay",

We're crippled and we're dazed\nA gardener like that one: no one can replace.\n\nAnd I've been knocking: but no one answers.\nAnd I've been knocking: most all the day.\nOh and I've been calling: oh hey: hey: Johnny!\nCan't you come out to play?\n\nAnd through their tears:\nSome say he farmed his best in younger years.\nBut he'd have said that roots grow stronger: if only he could hear.\nWho lived there?\nHe must have been a gardener that cared a lot:\nWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop.\nNow we pray for rain: and with every drop that falls\nWe hear: we hear your name\n\nAnd I've been knocking: but no one answers.\nAnd I've been knocking: most all the day.\nOh and I've been calling: oh hey: hey: Johnny!\nCan't you come out to play?\n\nAnd I've been knocking: but no one answers.\nAnd I've been knocking: most all the day.\nOh and I've been calling: oh hey: hey: Johnny!\nCan't you come out: can't you come out to play?\n\nJohnny?\nCan't you come out to play: in your empty garden?\nJohnny?\nCan't you come out to play: in your empty garden?\n\nJohnny?\nCan't you come out to play: in your empty garden?\nJohnny?\nCan't you come out to play: in your empty garden?\n\nJohnny?\nCan't you come out to play: in your empty garden?\nJohnny?\nCan't you come out to play: in your empty garden?",
