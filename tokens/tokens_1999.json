(After love: after love: after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough: no\n\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love: after love: after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough: no\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nSit around and wait for you\nWell: I can't do that\nAnd there's no turning back\n\nI need time to move on\nI need a love to feel strong\n'Cause I've had time to think it through\nAnd maybe I'm too good for you: oh\n\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love: after love: after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough: no\n\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love: after love: after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough: no\n\nWell: I know that I'll get through this\n'Cause I know that I am strong\n\nAnd I don't need you anymore\nOh: I don't need you anymore\nOh: I don't need you anymore\nNo: I don't need you anymore\n\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love: after love: after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough: no\n\nDo you believe in life after love? (After love: after love: after love)\nI can feel something inside me say\nI really don't think you're strong enough: no\n\nDo you believe in life after love?

If you can't spatially expand my horizons\nThen that leaves you in the class with scrubs: never risin'\nI don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the G's to please me\nAnd bounce from here to the coast of overseas\n\nSo: let me give you something to think about\nInundate your mind with intentions to turn you out\nCan't forget to focus on the picture in front of me\nDo it clear as DVD on digital TV screens\n\nSatisfy my appetite with something spectacular\nCheck your vernacular and then I'll get back to ya\nWith diamond-like precision: insatiable is what I envision\nCan't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition\n\nMr. Big Willie: if ya really wanna know\nAsk Chilli: could I be a silly hoe?\nNot with T-Boz and all my se&#xF1;oritas\nSteppin' on your Filas but you don't hear me though\n\nNo: I don't want no scrub\nA scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me\nHanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride\nTrying to holler at me\n\nI don't want no scrub\nA scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me\nHanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride\nTrying to holler at me",

(I'm not supposed to love you)\nNobody's supposed to be here (I'm not supposed to care anymore)\nI've tried that love thing for the last time\nMy heart says no: no (No: no: no: no: no: no)\nNobody's supposed to be here (No: no: no: no: no: no)\nBut you came along and changed my mind",

Fox was Alex P. Keaton\nWhen I met you: I said my name is Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer: for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer: since that summer\n\nCherry Pez: Coke Crush: Rock Stud: Boogie\nUsed to hate school so I had to play hooky\nAlways been hip to the B-boy style\nKnown to act wild and make a girl smile\n\nLove New Edition and the Candy Girl\nRemind me of you because you rock my world\nYou come from Georgia where the peaches grow\nThey drink lemonade and speak real slow\n\nYou love hip hop and rock and roll\nDad took off when you were four years old\nThere was a good man named Paul Revere\nI feel much better: baby: when you're near\n\nYou love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke\nI like the way you laugh when I tell a joke\nWhen I met you I said my name was Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer: for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer: since that summer\n\nIn the summertime girls got it goin' on\nShake and wiggle to a hip hop song\nSummertime girls are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\n\nBoogaloo Shrimp and pogo sticks\nMy mind takes me back there: oh: so quick\nLet you off the hook like my man Mr. Limpet\nThink about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it\n\nLike The Color Purple: macaroni and cheese\nRuby red slippers and a bunch of trees\nCall you up but what's the use?\nI like Kevin Bacon: but I hate Footloose\n\nCame in the door said it before\nI think I'm over you but I'm really not sure\nWhen I met you I said my name was Rich\nYou look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer: for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer: since that summer\n\n'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go\nSome are worth while and some are so so\nSummer girls come and summer girls go\nSome are worth while and some are so so\n\nSummertime girls got it goin' on\nShake and wiggle to a hip hop song\nSummertime girls are the kind I like\nI'll steal your honey like I stole your bike\n\nNew Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits\nChinese food makes me sick\nAnd I think it's fly when girls stop by\nFor the summer: for the summer\n\nI like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch\nI'd take her if I had one wish\nBut she's been gone\nSince that summer: since that summer",

A-when when come again (yeah yeah)\nWhen when come again (yeah yeah)\nMy friend come again (yeah yeah)\n\nGuys you know you'd better: watch out\nSome girls: some girls are only: about\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\n\nThe second verse is dedicated to the men\nMore concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women\nHim and his men: come in the club like hooligans\nDon't care who they offend: popping yin (Like you got Yen)\n\nLet's stop pretend: the ones that pack pistols by the waist men\nCristal by the case men: still living in his mother's basement\nThe pretty face men claiming that they be the big men\nNeed to take care of their three and four kids\n\nBut they face a court case when the child support's late\nMoney taking and heart breaking: now you wonder why women hate men\nThe sneaky silent men: the punk domestic violence men\nQuick to shoot the semen: stop acting like boys and be men\n\nHow you gonna win: when you ain't right within?\nHow you gonna win: when you ain't right within?\nHow you gonna win: when you ain't right within?\nUnh unh come again\nYo yo come again\nBrethren come again\nSistren come again\n\nWatch out: watch out\nLook out: look out\nWatch out: watch out\nLook out: look out\nWatch out: watch out\nLook out: look out\nWatch out: watch out\nLook out: look out\n\nGirls you know you'd better: watch out\nSome guys: some guys are only about\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\n\nGuys you know you'd better: watch out\nSome girls: some girls are only about\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\n\nGirls you know you'd better: watch out\nSome guys: some guys are only about\nThat thing: that thing: that thing\nThat thing: that thing: that thing",

I really beg you: my Lord\nTo me flirting is just like a sport\nAnything fly: it's all good: let me dump it\nPlease set in the trumpet\n\nA little bit of Monica in my life\nA little bit of Erica by my side\nA little bit of Rita is all I need\nA little bit of Tina is what I see\nA little bit of Sandra in the sun\nA little bit of Mary all night long\nA little bit of Jessica: here I am\nA little bit of you makes me your man\n\nMambo Number 5!\n\nJump up and down and move it all around\nShake your head to the sound\nPut your hands on the ground\nTake one step left and one step right\nOne to the front and one to the side\nClap your hands once and clap your hands twice\nAnd if it looks like this: then you're doing it right\n\nA little bit of Monica in my life\nA little bit of Erica by my side\nA little bit of Rita is all I need\nA little bit of Tina is what I see\nA little bit of Sandra in the sun\nA little bit of Mary all night long\nA little bit of Jessica: here I am\nA little bit of you makes me your man\n\nTrumpet!\nThe trumpet!\nMambo Number 5!\nHa ha ha!\n\nA little bit of Monica in my life\nA little bit of Erica by my side\nA little bit of Rita is all I need\nA little bit of Tina is what I see\nA little bit of Sandra in the sun\nA little bit of Mary all night long\nA little bit of Jessica: here I am\nA little bit of you makes me your man\n\nI do all to\nFall in love with a girl like you\n'Cause you can't run and you can't hide\nYou and me gonna touch the sky\n\nMambo Number 5!",

        "Lyrics": "Friday night you and your boys went out to eat\nThen they hung out\nBut you came home around three\nIf six of y'all went out\nThen four of you were really cheap\n'Cause only two of you had dinner\nI found your credit card receipt\n\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\n\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\n\nClose the door behind you\nLeave your key\nI'd rather be alone\nThan unhappy\n\nI'll pack your bags\nSo you can leave town for a week\nThe phone rings\nAnd then you look at me\n\nYou said it was one of your friends\nDown on 54th Street\nSo why did 2-1-3\nShow up on your caller ID?\n\nI've been through all of this before\nSo how could you think\nThat I would stand around\nAnd take some more\n\nThings are gonna change\nThat's why you have to leave\nSo don't turn around to see my face\nThere's no more tears left here\nFor you to see\n\nWas it really worth you going out like that\nSee I'm moving on\nAnd I refuse to turn back\nSee all of this time\nI thought I had somebody down for me\nIt turns out\nYou were making a fool of me\n\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\n\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\n\nClose the door behind you\nLeave your key\nI'd rather be alone\nThan unhappy\n\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\n\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\n\nClose the door behind you\nLeave your key\nI'd rather be alone\nThan unhappy\n\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\n\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\n\nClose the door behind you\nLeave your key\nI'd rather be alone\nThan unhappy\n\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\n\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\n\nClose the door behind you\nLeave your key\nI'd rather be alone\nThan unhappy\n\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\n\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's not right\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\n\nClose the door behind you\nLeave your key\nI'd rather be alone\nThan unhappy",

        "Lyrics": "Guess what I did today\nThose were the words I said to you\nIt was last may: don't know the exact day\nIn my hand there was a ring\nThen you told me that you loved me\nMore than anything in your life\nSo I asked you would you do me\nThe honor of being my wife\n\n(Yes I will)\nI will be your man\nYour protector: your best friend\nTill my humble life is ended\nAnd time begins again: couldn't we\n\nCouldn't we be happily ever after?\nWe could be strong together for so long\nCouldn't we be happily ever after?\nLeaving you never till forevers gone\n\nWhen I was away: mmm: mmm\nSome friends became just faces\nSome people grew apart\nBut you stayed right in my heart\nAnd so many times\nPictured this day inside my mind\nAnd for so many years: ooh\nI knew it would be you here with me: oh\n\n(Yes I will)\nTake you for my wife\nThe center of my life\nAnd I will never: ever fade\nFrom this choice I made: oh\n\nCouldn't we be happily ever after?\nWe could be strong together for so long\nCouldn't we be happily ever after?\nLeaving you never till forevers gone\n\n\nHey yeah\nYou don't have to look no further than me\n(Don't look no more: baby yeah)\nYou don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy\n(I'm so happy: babe)\nBeneath the sign of God: I will make this vow to you (come on baby)\nI'll be right here: stay with me (said I'll be here: baby hey)\n\nCouldn't we be happily ever after\nWe could be strong together for so long\nCouldn't we be happily ever after\nLeaving you never stays forever strong\n(No: no I will never leave you: ooh)",

Ya feel me? Let's make 'em dance\nLet's go\n\nHave a good time\nLay back: relax\nJust free your mind\nLet the music take control of you\n\nRepeat 1 until fade",

Oh: no. Oh: no)\nIt's like running out of love\n(No matter what you say: no)\nAnd then it's too late to talk about it\n(Too late to talk about it)\n\nYou can cry a river\nTill an ocean starts to form: yeah\nBut she will always remember\n'Cause she's a woman scorned\nAnd if you ever get her back\nIt will never be the same\nShe's cuttin' the corners of her eyes\nEvery time she see your face\nNow your trust is out the door\nShe don't want you no more\nYou used to tell your boys: not me\nAnd she would always be there for you\nIf you had took the time to see\nWhat that woman meant to you\nIs what the mirror said to me: whoa\nShe was raised in Illinois\nRight outside of Chicago\nSome of the best cookin' you ever had\nYes: it was and I miss her\nHey woman: if you're listening\nI said I miss you baby",

Was I out of my mind?\nHow could I have ever been so blind?\nI was waiting for an indication\nIt was hard to find\nDon't matter what I say: only what I do\nI never mean to do bad things to you\nSo quiet that I finally woke up\nIf you're sad then it's time you spoke up too\n\nWas I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?\nHow could I have ever been so blind?\nI was waiting for an invitation\nIt was hard to find\nDon't matter what I say: only what I do\nI never mean to do bad things to you\nSo quiet but I finally woke up\nIf you're sad then it's time you spoke up... too",

Fuck naw\nWhere all my niggas with the rubber grips: bust shots\nAnd if you with me: mama rub on ya tits: and what not\nI'm from the school of the hard knocks: we must not\nLet outsiders violate our blocks and my plot\nLet's stick up the world and split it 50-50: uh huh\nLet's take the dough and stay real jiggy: uh huh\nLet's sip the Cris and get pissy pissy\nFlow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie: baby!\nYou know its hell when I come through\nThe life and times of Shawn Carter: nigga: Volume 2 - Y'all niggas get ready\n\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\n'Stead of treated: we get tricked\n'Stead of kisses: we get kicked\nIt's the Hard Knock Life\n\nI flow for those droed out\nAll my niggas locked down in the 10 by 4 controllin' the house\nWe live in hard knocks we don't take over we bomb blocks\nBurn 'em down and you can have 'em back daddy: I'd rather that\nI flow for chicks wishin' they ain't have to strip to pay tuition\nI see you vision mama\nI put my money on the long shots: all my ballers that's born to clock\nNow I'ma be on top whether I perform or not\nI went from lukewarm to hot: sleepin' on futons and cots:\nTo king size: green machines: to green 5's\nI've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills\nThen I put it down tight real\nI'm tight grill with the phony rappers: you might feel we homeys\nI'm like still you don't know me: shit\nI'm tight real when my situation ain't improvin'\nI'm tryin' to murder everythin' movin': Feel Me\n\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\n'Stead of treated: we get tricked\n'Stead of kisses: we get kicked\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\n'Stead of treated: we get tricked\n'Stead of kisses: we get kicked\nIt's the Hard Knock Life\n\nI don't know how to sleep: I gotta eat: stay on my toes\nGot a lot of beef so logically I prey on my foes\nHustlin' still inside of me and as far as progress\nYou be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me\nI gave you prophecy on my first joint: and ya all lamed out\nDidn't really appreciate it till the second one came out\nSo I stretched the game out: X'ed your name out\nPut Jigga on top: and drop albums non-stop for ya nigga\n\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\n'Stead of treated: we get tricked\n'Stead of kisses: we get kicked\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\nIt's the Hard Knock Life for us\n'Stead of treated: we get tricked\n'Stead of kisses: we get kicked\nIt's the Hard Knock Life\nIt's the Hard Knock Life\nIt's the Hard Knock Life",

Kelly)\nHe don't understand you like I do\nNo he'll never make love to you like I do\nSo give it to me\n'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love\nAnd I can promise anything that I do\nIs just to satisfy you\n\n(Puffy)\nWhen it hurt I ease the pain girl: caress your frame\nGet them worries off your brain girl: I'm in your corner\nDo what you want: it's your thing girl: opposites attract but\nWe one and the same girl: it ain't a game\nSo I can't play witchu: I wanna lay witchu\nStay witchu: pray witchu: grow old and gray witchu\nIn good and bad times: we'll always make it through\n'Cause what we got is true: no matter what they say to you\nI could straight lace you: not just appearance\nStimulate your mind: strengthen your spirits\nBe that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it\nYou want it but you fear it: but you love it when you near it\nSit her on the sofa: get a little closer\nTouch you right: do it like a man's suppose to\nKnew you was the one: that's why I chose you\n'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier\n\n(R. Kelly)\nHe don't understand you like I do\nNo he'll never make love to you like I do\nSo give it to me\n'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love\nAnd I can promise anything that I do\nIs just to satisfy you\n\n(Puffy)\nYour soul ain't a toy: you ain't dealin' with a boy\nFeel emptiness inside? I can fill that void\nWhen you spend time with your woman and listen\nIt shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten\nI can't impress you with the cars and the wealth\n'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself\nI'd rather show you it's heartfelt: make your heart melt\nAnd prove to you you're more important than anything else\nWorthwhile: special like my first child\nWhen I see your face it's always like the first time\nOur eyes met: I knew we'd be together in a tri jet\nI wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet\nHold you: mold you: don't know: let me show you\nAin't no tellin' what we could grow to\nLet it be known: I told you\nAnd I'mma be there for whatever you go through: my love's true\n\n(R. Kelly)\nHe don't understand you like I do\nNo he'll never make love to you like I do\nSo give it to me\n'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love\nAnd I can promise anything that I do\nIs just to satisfy you\n\n(R. Kelly II)\nDon't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)\nWaiting for love like this too long\n(You don't have to wait: you don't have to wait on him: baby)\nAll that you need I can give you\n(You don't have to wait: you don't have to wait on)\nI do: satisfy you\n(You don't have to wait on him)\n\n(Puffy)\nI'm that light when you can't see\nI'm that air when you can't breathe\nI'm that feeling when you can't leave\nSome doubt: some believe: some lie: cheat: and deceive\nSo it's only you and me\nWhen you weak: I'll make you strong: here's where you belong\nI ain't perfect: but I promise I won't do you wrong\nKeep you away from harm: my love is protected\nI'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected\nI'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair\nI'm the courage when you're scared\nLoyal: down for you: soon as I saw you\nWanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you\nBe around for you: plant seeds in the soil\nMake love all night: bending bed coils\nYou're a queen: therefore I treat you royal\nThis is all for you: 'cause I simply adore you\n\n(R. Kelly)\nHe don't understand you like I do\nNo he'll never make love to you like I do\nSo give it to me\n'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love\nAnd I can promise anything that I do\nIs just to satisfy you\n\n(Puffy)\nThis one right here goes out to all my sisters",

(You can achieve)\nWhen you believe: somehow you will: you will when you believe\n\nThey don't always happen when you ask\nAnd it's easy to give in to your fears\nOhh: but when you're blinded by your pain\nCan't see your way clear through the rain\nA small: but still resilient voice says hope is very near \n\nThere can be miracles\nMiracles\nWhen you believe\nBoy: when you believe: ohh\nThough hope is frail: it's hard...\nHard to kill: yeah\n\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve? \nYou can achieve: ohh\nWhen you believe: somehow you will\nSomehow: somehow: somehow\n\nSomehow you will\nI know: I know: know\nYou will when you believe\nWhen you believe...\n\nOhh: you will when you...\nYou will when you believe\nJust believe\nYou will: you will\nJust believe\nYou will when you believe",
