What? What? What?\nWhat? What? What? What?\nWhat? What? What?

I got a big cock!\"\nNah: I'm just pumped: bought some shit from a thrift shop (Ho!)\nIce on the fringe is so damn frosty\nThe people like \"Damn: that's a cold-ass honky!\"\n\nRolling in hella deep: headed to the mezzanine\nDressed in all pink except my gator shoes: those are green (Ho!)\nDraped in a leopard mink: girl standing next to me\nProbably shoulda washed this: smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Piss)\nBut shit: it was ninety-nine cents!\n\nBag it: copping it: washing it: 'bout to go and get some compliments\nPassing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in\nBummy and grudgy: fucking it: I am stunting and flossing and\nSaving my money and I'm hella happy: that's a bargain: bitch\n\nImma take your grandpa's style\nImma take your grandpa's style\nNo for real: ask your grandpa\nCan I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)\n\nVelour jumpsuit and some house slippers\nDookie brown leather jacket that I found: dig it\nThey had a broken keyboard: I bought a broken keyboard\nI bought a skeet blanket: then I bought a knee board (Ho!)\n\nHello: hello: my ace man: my Mello\nJohn Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game: hell no\nI could take some Pro Wings: make them cool: sell those\nThe sneaker heads would be like \"Ah: he got the Velcros!\" (Ho!)\n\nI'm gonna pop some tags\nOnly got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)\nI'm: I'm: I'm hunting: looking for a come up\nThis is fucking awesome\n\nOw: ow\nI'm gonna pop some tags\nOnly got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)\nI'm: I'm: I'm hunting: looking for a come up\nThis is fucking awesome\n\nWhat you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?\nWhat you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin? (Ho!)\nI'm digging: I'm digging: I'm searching right through that luggage\nOne man's trash: that's another man's come up (Ho!)\n\nThank your granddad for donating that plaid button-\nUp shirt: 'cause right now: I'm up in here stuntin'\nI'm at the Goodwill: you can find me in the (Uptons)\nI'm that: I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)\n\nYour grammy: your aunty: your momma: your mammy\nI'll take those flannel zebra jammies: secondhand and rock that motherfucker\nThe built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker\nI hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker (Ho!)\n\nThey be like \"Oh that Gucci: that's hella tight!\"\nI'm like \"Yo: that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!\"\nLimited edition: let's do some simple addition\nFifty dollars for a t-shirt: that's just some ignorant bitch shit\nI call that getting swindled and pimped: shit\nI call that getting tricked by a business (Ho!)\nThat shirt's hella dough\nAnd having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't (Ho!)\nPeep game: come take a look through my telescope\nTrying to get girls from a brand: man: you hella won't (Ho!)\nMan: you hella won't\n\nHo!\n\n(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah)\n\nOw: ow\n\nI'm gonna pop some tags\nOnly got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)\nI'm: I'm: I'm hunting: looking for a come up\nThis is fucking awesome (Ho!)\n\nI'll wear your granddad's clothes\nI look incredible\nI'm in this big ass coat \nFrom that thrift shop down the road\n\nI wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)\nI look incredible (Now: c'mon: man)\nI'm in this big ass coat (big ass coat)\nFrom that thrift shop down the road (let's go)\n\nI'm gonna pop some tags\nOnly got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)\nI'm: I'm: I'm hunting: looking for a come up\nThis is fucking awesome (Ho!)\n\nHa: ha: ha\nIs that your grandma's coat?",

        "Lyrics": "Alright: okay\nAlright: okay\nAlright: okay\n\nReturn of the Mack: get up\nWhat it is: what it does: what it is: what it isn't\nLooking for a better way to get up out of bed\nInstead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit\n\nWe get up: fresh out: pimp strut walking\nLittle bit of humble: little bit of cautious\nSomewhere between like: Rocky and Cosby: Sweater Gang\nNope: nope: y'all can't copy\n\nYup: bad: moonwalkin': this here: is our party\nMy posse's been on Broadway and we did it our way\nGrown music\nI shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it\nAnd yet I'm on\n\nLet that stage light go and shine on down\nGot the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style\nMoney: stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds\nBut I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town\n\nTrust me: I'm a I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler\nChasing dreams since I was fourteen\nWith the four track: busing halfway cross that city with the backpack\nFat cat crushin': labels out here\n\nNah they can't tell me nothing: we give that to the people\nSpread it across the country: labels out here\nNah they can't tell me nothing: we give it to the people\nSpread it across the country\n\nCan we go back: this is the moment\nTonight is the night: we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\nHere we go back: this is the moment\nTonight is the night: we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\nNow: can I kick it? Thank you\nYeah I'm so damn grateful\nI grew up really wanting gold fronts\nBut that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you\n\nY'all can't stop me\nI go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat\nAnd I'm eating at the beat\nLike you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week\n\n(Raw! Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces: goodbye\nI've got a world to see;\nAnd my girl: she wanna see Rome\nCaesar'll make you a believer\nNah: I never ever did it for a throne\nThat validation comes\nSo I'm giving it back to the people now\nSing that song and it goes like\n\nRaise those hands: this is our party\nWe came here to live life like nobody was watching\nI got my city right behind me\nIf I fall: they got me\nLearn from that failure: gain humility\nAnd then we keep marching: I said\n\nHere we go back: this is the moment\nTonight is the night: we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\nHere we go back: this is the moment\nTonight is the night: we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\n(And so we put our hands up)\n(And so we put our hands up)\nOh: oh: oh\n\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nHey: and all my people say\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nHey: and all my people say\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nOh: and all my people say\n\"Na na nana na nana na.\"\nMack-le-more\n\nHere we go back: this is the moment\nTonight is the night: we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us\n\nHere we go back: this is the moment\nTonight is the night: we'll fight till it's over\nSo we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us\nLike the ceiling can't hold us",

        "Lyrics": "There was a time: I used to look into my father's eyes\nIn a happy home: I was a king: I had a golden throne\nThose days are gone: now the memory's on the wall\nI hear the songs from the places where I was born\n\nUpon the hill across the blue lake\nThat's where I had my first heartbreak\nI still remember how it all changed\nMy father said\n\nDon't you worry: don't you worry child\nSee heaven's got a plan for you\nDon't you worry: don't you worry now\nYeah!\n\nDon't you worry: don't you worry child\nSee heaven's got a plan for you\nDon't you worry: don't you worry now\nYeah!\n\nThere was a time: I met a girl of a different kind\nWe ruled the world: I thought I'd never lose her out of sight\nWe were so young: I think of her now and then\nI still hear the songs reminding me of a friend\n\nUpon the hill across the blue lake\nThat's where I had my first heartbreak\nI still remember how it all changed\nMy father said\n\nDon't you worry: don't you worry child\nSee heaven's got a plan for you\nDon't you worry: don't you worry now\nYeah!\n\nOhh...\nOoh...\nOhh...\nSee heaven's got a plan for you\n\nDon't you worry: don't you worry child\nSee heaven's got a plan for you\nDon't you worry: don't you worry now\nYeah!\n\nOhh...\nOoh...\nOhh...\nYeah!",

        "Lyrics": "Heading down south to the land of the pines\nI'm thumbing my way into North Caroline\nStaring up the road and pray to God I see headlights\nI made it down the coast in seventeen hours\nPicking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers\nAnd I'm a-hoping for Raleigh: I can see my baby tonight\n\nSo rock me mama like a wagon wheel\nRock me mama any way you feel\nHey mama rock me\nRock me mama like the wind and the rain\nRock me mama like a south bound train\nHey mama rock me\n\nRunning from the cold up in New England\nI was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band\nMy baby plays a guitar: I pick a banjo now\nOh: north country winters keep a-getting me down\nLost my money playing poker so I had to leave town\nBut I ain't turning back to living that old life no more\n\nSo rock me mama like a wagon wheel\nRock me mama any way you feel\nHey mama rock me\nRock me mama like the wind and the rain\nRock me mama like a south bound train\nHey mama rock me\n\nWalking to the south out of Roanoke\nI caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke\nBut he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap\nTo Johnson City: Tennessee\nAnd I got to get a move on before the sun\nI hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one\nAnd if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free\n\nSo rock me mama like a wagon wheel\nRock me mama any way you feel\nHey mama rock me\nOh rock me mama like the wind and the rain\nRock me mama like a south bound train\nHey hey mama rock me\nSo rock me mama like a wagon wheel\nRock me mama any way you feel\nHey hey mama rock me\nMama rock me\nMama rock me\nRock me mama like the wind and the rain\nRock me mama like a south bound train\nHey hey mama rock me\nYou can rock me\nRock me",

What do I stand for?\nMost nights: I don't know anymore\n\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah oh oh\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah oh oh\n\nThis is it: boys: this is war\nWhat are we waiting for?\nWhy don't we break the rules already?\n\nI was never one to believe the hype\nSave that for the black and white\nI try twice as hard and I'm half as liked\nBut here they come again to jack my style\n\nAnd that's alright\nI found a martyr in my bed tonight\nShe stops my bones from wondering just who I am: who I am: who I am\nOh: who am I? mmm: mmm\n\nWell: some nights: I wish that this all would end\n'Cause I could use some friends for a change\nAnd some nights: I'm scared you'll forget me again\nSome nights: I always win: I always win\n\nBut I still wake up: I still see your ghost\nOh Lord: I'm still not sure what I stand for: oh\nWhat do I stand for? What do I stand for?\nMost nights: I don't know (come on)\n\nSo this is it? I sold my soul for this?\nWashed my hands of that for this?\nI miss my mom and dad for this?\n\nNo. When I see stars: when I see: when I see stars: that's all they are\nWhen I hear songs: they sound like a swan: so come on\nOh: come on\nOh: come on\nOh: come on\n\nWell: this is it guys: that is all\nFive minutes in and I'm bored again\nTen years of this: I'm not sure if anybody understands\n\nThis one is not for the folks at home\nSorry to leave: mom: I had to go\nWho the fuck wants to die alone\nAll dried up in the desert sun?\n\nMy heart is breaking for my sister\nAnd the con that she call \"love\"\nBut when I look into my nephew's eyes\nMan: you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from\n\nSome terrible nights\nAhh: ahh\nAhh: ahh\n\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah: oh oh\nOh woah: oh woah: oh woah: oh oh\n\nThe other night: you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me\nI called you up: but we'd both agree\n\nIt's for the best you didn't listen\nIt's for the best we get our distance: oh\nIt's for the best you didn't listen\nIt's for the best we get our distance: oh",

Let's be crazy\n\nI wanna be scared: don't wanna know why\nWanna feel good: don't have to be right\nThe world makes all kinds of rules for love\nI say you gotta let it do what it does\n\nI don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight\nCatchin' up calls and a date sometimes\nA love that revels and stills believes\nWe're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be: yeah\n\nOh: I know we're crazy: yeah\n\nBut I don't want good and I don't want good enough\nI want can't sleep: can't breathe without your love\nFront porch and one more kiss: it doesn't make sense to anybody else\nWho cares if you're all I think about:\nI've searched the world and I know now:\nIt ain't right if you ain't lost your mind\nYeah I don't want easy: I want crazy\nYou with me baby? Let's be crazy\n\nNo! I don't want good and I don't want good enough\nI want can't sleep: can't breathe without your love\nFront porch and one more kiss: it doesn't make sense to anybody else\nWho cares if you're all I think about:\nI've searched the world and I know now:\nIt ain't right if you ain't lost your mind\nYeah I don't want easy: I want crazy\n\nYeah: look at us baby: tonight the midnight rules are breaking\nThere's no such thing as wild enough: maybe we just think too much\nWho needs to play it safe in love...\nLet's be crazy!\n\nWho cares if we're crazy: we gotta be crazy\nI know that we're crazy: so let's be crazy\nYeah...",

        "Lyrics": "Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up\nWhen you wake up: you're pretty enough\nLook out your window at the cloud of dust\nThat's my headlights: that's my truck\n\nCome on baby: don't you keep me waitin'\nI gotta go: I've got a reservation\nTailgate for two underneath the stars\nKiss on your lips when you're in my arms\n\nWhoa\nGirl: every now and then you get a night like this\nWhoa\nThis is one that we don't wanna miss: no\n\nCome on baby let me take you on a night ride\nWindows down: sittin' on my side\nTick tock now we're knocking on midnight\nMe and you girl runnin' outta moonlight\nI wanna hold you till the break of dawn\nHear the crickets sing a riverside love song\nHey baby: all we got is all night\nCome on now we're runnin' outta moonlight\n\nGirl I bet you thought I lost my mind\nOutta the blue pulling into your drive\nWonder why I got you way out here\nHave you ever seen a sky this clear\n\nWhoa\nGirl: you never look better than you do right now\nWhoa\nOh heaven: let your light shine down\n\nCome on baby let me take you on a night ride\nWindows down: sittin' on my side\nTick tock now we're knocking on midnight\nMe and you girl runnin' outta moonlight\nI wanna hold you till the break of dawn\nHear the crickets sing a riverside love song\nHey baby: all we got is all night\nCome on now we're runnin' outta moonlight\n\nWhoa\nGirl: every now and then you get a night like this\nWhoa\nThis is one that we don't wanna miss: no\n\nCome on baby let me take you on a night ride\nWindows down: sittin' on my side\nTick tock now we're knocking on midnight\nMe and you girl runnin' outta moonlight\nI wanna hold you till the break of dawn\nHear the crickets sing a riverside love song\nHey baby: all we got is all night\nCome on now we're runnin' outta moonlight\n\nHey baby don't it feel so right\nCome on now we're runnin' outta moonlight\nAll I wanna do is hold you tight\nCome on: come on: come on we're runnin' outta moonlight\n\nWhoa\nYea we're runnin' outta moonlight\nWhoa",
