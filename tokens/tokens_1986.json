(Don't trust your feelings)\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know?

I'm shaking\nWish I had you near me now: uhh\nSaid there's no mistaking\nWhat I feel is really love\n\nOoh: tell me: how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)\nHow will I know?\nHow will I know?

        "Lyrics": "Think about it: there must be higher love\nDown in the heart or hidden in the stars above\nWithout it: life is wasted time\nLook inside your heart: I'll look inside mine\n\nThings look so bad everywhere\nIn this whole world: what is fair?\nWe walk blind and we try to see\nFalling behind in what could be\n\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love: oh\nBring me a higher love\nWhere's that higher love I keep thinking of?\n\nWorlds are turning: and we're just hanging on\nFacing our fear and standing out there alone\nA yearning and it's real to me\nThere must be someone who's feeling for me\n\nThings look so bad everywhere\nIn this whole world: what is fair?\nWe walk blind and we try to see\nFalling behind in what could be\n\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love: oh\nBring me a higher love\nWhere's that higher love I keep thinking of?\n\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love: oh\nBring me a higher love\nA good kind of love: want a higher love\n\nI will wait for it\nI'm not too late for it\nUntil then: I'll sing my song\nTo cheer the night along\n\nBring it: oh\n\nI could light the night up with my soul on fire\nI could make the sun shine from pure desire\nLet me feel that love come over me\nLet me feel how strong it could be\n\nWhoa: bring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love: oh\nBring me a higher love\nWhere's that higher love I keep thinking of\n\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love: oh (bring me)\nBring be a higher love (whoa)\nBring be a higher love (whoa: bring me a higher love)\n\nBring me a higher love (I said bring me)\nBring me a higher love: oh (I said bring me)\nBring be a higher love\nBring be a higher love\n\nBring me a higher love (whoa-oh-oh: bring a higher love)\nBring me a higher love: oh (bring me higher love)\nBring be a higher love (got love: bring me higher love)\nBring be a higher love (with that love: whoa)\n\nBring me a higher love (I said bring me)\nBring me a higher love: oh (oh yeah: bring me higher love)\nBring be a higher love (higher: higher: higher)\nBring be a higher love\n\nBring me a higher love\nBring me a higher love",

Let's get down!\n\nSo come on! Let's get loose\nDon't hold back\n'Cause ain't no use\nHard to keep your feet on the ground\n'Cause when we like to party\nWe only want to get down\n\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\n\n(Scream: whistles) Say what?\nCan't stop now\nJust getting started\nEverybody clap your hands\nCome on\nEverybody let's dance\n\n(Oh: oh: oh: oh)\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\nBaby: baby\nWe gonna dance all night\nTill the broad daylight\nKeep on movin': keep on groovin'\nOh yeah\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling\n\nOh: what a feeling\nWhen we're dancing on the ceiling...",

(Oh-oh)\n\nWe don't have to take our clothes off (Oh no)\nTo have a good time: oh no\nWe could dance and party all night (Dance and party all night)\nAnd drink some cherry wine: uh-huh (We don't have)\nWe don't have to take our clothes off (Clothes off: no)\nTo have a good time: oh no (Oh no)\nWe could dance and party all night (Dance and party: yeah)\nAnd drink some cherry wine: uh-huh (Cherry wine)\n\nNa: na: na: na: na-na-na: na: na (Oh-oh)\nNa: na: na: na: na-na-na: na: na (Na-na: na-na)\nNa: na: na: na: na-na-na: na: na (Oh-oh: oh-oh)\nNa: na: na: na: na-na-na: na: na (Oh...)\n\nWe don't have to take our clothes off\nTo have a good time: oh no\nWe could dance and party all night (All night: all night long)\nAnd drink some cherry wine: uh-huh (Cherry wine: cherry wine)\nWe don't have to take our clothes off (No...)\nTo have a good time: oh no\nWe could dance and party all night (Dance and party: yeah)",

(Leavin' me all alone)\n\nDon't you know the heart will cause an inferno\nRomance up in flames: why should I take the blame\nYou were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)\nApology not accepted: add me to the broken hearts you collected\n\nAh: I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)\nHow was I to know you would weaken so easily\nI: I don't what to do\nI'm all cried out (I'm all) over you (I'm cried out too)\n(Whoa: whoa...)\n\nAh: I gave you my love in vain\nMy body never knew such pleasure\nMy heart never knew such pain\nAnd you\n(I left you so confused: now I'm all cried out)\nNow I'm all cried out\nOver you",

Knock out this!\n\nSuper highways: coast to coast\nEasy to get anywhere\nOn the transcontinental overload\nJust slide behind the wheel\nHow does it feel\n\nWhen there's no destination that's too far\nAnd somewhere on the way\nYou might find out who you are\n\nLiving in America\nEye to eye: station to station\nLiving in America\nHand to hand: across the nation\nLiving in America\nGot to have a celebration\nRock my soul\n\nSmokestack: fatback\nMany miles of railroad track\nAll night radio: keep on runnin' through\nYour rock 'n' roll soul\nAll night diners keep you awake: hey\nOn black coffee and a hard roll\n\nYou might have to walk the fine line\nYou might take the hard line\nBut everybody's working overtime\n\nLiving in America\nEye to eye: station to station\nLiving in America\nHand to hand: across the nation\nLiving in America\nGot to have a celebration\n\nI live in America: help me out\nBut I live in America\nWait a minute\n\nYou may not be looking for the promised land\nBut you might find it anyway\nUnder one of those old familiar names\nLike New Orleans (New Orleans)\nDetroit City (Detroit City): Dallas (Dallas)\nPittsburgh P.A. (Pittsburgh P.A.)\nNew York City (New York City)\nKansas City (Kansas City)\nAtlanta (Atlanta)\nChicago and L.A.\n\nLiving in America - hit me\nLiving in America - yeah\nI walk in and out\nLiving in America\n\nI live in America - state lines\nGonna make the prime: that\nI live in America - hey\nI know what it means: I\n\nLiving in America\nEddie Murphy: eat your heart out\nLiving in America\nHit me: I said now\nEye to eye: Station to station\nLiving in America\nSo nice: with your bad self\nLiving in America - I feel good!",

Can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running? Can you hear me calling you?\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running? Can you hear me calling you?\n\nThere's a gun and ammunition\nJust inside the doorway\nUse it only in emergency\nBetter you should pray to God\nThe Father and the Spirit\nWill guide you and protect from up here\n\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running? Can you hear me calling you?\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running? Can you hear me calling you?\n\n(Can you hear me?)\n\nSwear allegiance to the flag\nWhatever flag they offer\nNever hint at what you really feel\nTeach the children quietly\nFor someday sons and daughters\nWill rise up and fight while we stood still\n\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running? Can you hear me calling you?\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running? Can you hear me calling you?\n\nCan you hear me?

        "Lyrics": "No more runnin' down the wrong road\nDancin' to a diff'rent drum\nCan't you see what's goin' on\nDeep inside your heart\n\nAlways searchin' for the real thing\nLivin' like it's far away\nJust leave all the madness in yesterday\nYou're holdin' the key\nWhen you believe it\n\nShine sweet freedom\nShine your light on me\nYou are the magic\nYou're right where I wanna be\nOh sweet freedom carry me along\nWe'll keep the spirit alive on and on\n\nWe'll be dancin' in the moonlight\nSmilin' with the risin' sun\nLivin' like we've never done\nGoin' all the way\n\nReachin' out to meet the changes\nTouchin' every shining star\nThe light of tomorrow is right where we are\nThere's no turnin' back\nFrom what I'm feeling\n\nShine sweet freedom\nShine your light on me\nYou are the magic\nYou're right where I wanna be\nOh sweet freedom carry me along\nWe'll keep the spirit alive on and on\n\n'Cause there'll be starlight all night\nWhen we're close together\nShare those feelings dancin' in your eyes tonight\nThey're guiding us\nShinin' till the mornin' light\n\nShine sweet freedom\nShine your light on me\nYou are the magic\nYou're right where I wanna be\nOh sweet freedom carry me along\nWe'll keep the spirit alive on and on",

        "Lyrics": "Her parents said: girl don't leave home\nBut her heart kept cheering her on\nShe had a real good man: steady job\nBut the two of them just weren't in her heart \n\nShe only wanted to be close to me\nTo give me the love she knew someday I'd need\nBut I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home \n\nLong days: short nights when you're on the road\nFor a pretty girl it's a heavy load\nAnd even so who'll pay your fare\nShe said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer\n\nShe only wanted to be close to me\nTo give me the love she knew someday I'd need\nBut I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home\n\nShe said I've on right to tell her how life should be\nEspecially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me\nBut she agreed to go along with my final word \n\nAs fate would have life come around\nMy world started tumbling down\nI lost my family: my friends and job\nAnd set free the only one who stuck with me from the start \n\nShe only wanted to be close to me\nTo give me the love she knew someday I'd need\nBut I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home  \n\nShe said I've on right to tell her how life should be\nEspecially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me\nBut she agreed to go along with my final word: my final word \n\nAs fate would have life come around\nMy world started tumbling down\nI lost my family: my friends and job\nAnd set free the only one who stuck with me from the start \n\nShe only wanted to be close to me\nTo give me the love she knew someday I'd need\nBut I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home\nShe only wanted to be close to me\nTo give me the love she knew someday I'd need\nBut I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home\nGo home baby: you better go home right now\nGo home: little girl you better go home",
