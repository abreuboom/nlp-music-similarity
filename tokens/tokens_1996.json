Don't you think?\n\nIt's like rain on your wedding day\nIt's a free ride when you've already paid\nIt's the good advice that you just didn't take\nAnd who would've thought? It figures\n\nMr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly\nHe packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye\nHe waited his whole damn life to take that flight\nAnd as the plane crashed down: he thought: \"Well: isn't this nice?\"\nAnd isn't it ironic? Don't you think?\n\nIt's like rain on your wedding day\nIt's a free ride when you've already paid\nIt's the good advice that you just didn't take\nAnd who would've thought? It figures\n\nWell: life has a funny way of sneaking up on you\nWhen you think everything's okay and everything's going right\nAnd life has a funny way of helping you out\nWhen you think everything's gone wrong\nAnd everything blows up in your face\n\nA traffic jam when you're already late\nA \"No Smoking\" sign on your cigarette break\nIt's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife\nIt's meeting the man of my dreams\nAnd then meeting his beautiful wife: hmph\nAnd isn't it ironic? Don't you think?\nA little too ironic: and yeah I really do think\n\nIt's like rain on your wedding day\nIt's a free ride when you've already paid\nIt's the good advice that you just didn't take\nAnd who would've thought? It figures\n\nAnd yeah: oh: life has a funny way of sneaking up on you\nLife has a funny: funny way of helping you out\nHelping you out",

        "Lyrics": "Seems like ever since the first day we met\nThere is no one else I think of more than you\nCan't seem to forget: can't get you out my head\nGuess the verdict's in: I'm crazy over you\nHow can one be down: tell me where to start\nCause every time you smile: I feel trembles in my heart\nI have but one concern: how can I get with you\nTill my day comes: here's what I'm gonna do\n\nChrous:\nBe sittin' up in my room\nBack here thinkin' 'bout you\nI must confess: I'm a mess for you\nBe sittin' up in my room\nBack here thinkin' 'bout you\nI'm just a mess with a thang for you\n\nPray that you'll invest in my happiness\nAll it takes is just one simple word from you\nTurn my heart around: if I'm making ground\nPretty baby please: tell me if I'm getting through\nTell me what is up\nYou see I need to know\nTell me if I'm far or: if I'm getting close\nI have but one concern: and that one concern is you\nTill I'm with you: here's what I'm gonna do\n\n(Repeat Chrous)\n\nHow can one be down: tell me where to start\nCause every time you smile: I feel trembles in my heart\nI have but one concern: how can I get with you\nTill my day comes: here's what I'm gonna do\n\n(Repeat Chrous till fade)",

        "Lyrics": "How do U want it? How does it feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\nHow do U want it: yeah? How do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\n\nLove the way you activate your hips and push your ass out\nGot a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out\nWanna dig you and I can't even lie about it\nBaby just alleviate your clothes: time to fly up out it\n\nCatch you at a club: oh shit you got me fiendin'\nBody talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning\nNow if you wanna roll with me: then here's your chance\nDoin' eighty on the freeway: police catch me if you can\n\nForgive me I'm a rider: still I'm just a simple man\nAll I want is money: fuck the fame I'm a simple man\nMr. International: playa with the passport\nJust like Aladdin bitch: get you anything you ask for\n\nIt's either him or me: champagne: Hennessy\nA favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies\nWitness as we creep to a low speed: peep what a hoe need\nPuff some mo' weed: funk: ya don't need\n\nApproachin' hoochies with a passion: been a long day\nBut I've been driven by attraction in a strong way\nYour body is bangin' baby: I love it when you flaunt it\nTime to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it\n\nHow do U want it? How does it feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\nHow do U want it? How do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nI'm livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\n\nTell me is it cool to fuck?\nDid you think I come to talk: am I a fool or what?\nPositions on the floor it's like erotic: ironic\n'Cause I'm some what psychotic\nI'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics\n\nUp and down like a roller coaster: I'm up inside ya\nI ain't quittin' till the show is over: 'cause I'mma rider\nIn and out just like a robbery: I'll probably be a freak\nAnd let you get on top of me: get her rockin' these\n\nNights full of Aliz&#xE9;: a livin' legend\nYou ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days\nDelores Tucker: you'se a motherfucker\nInstead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother\n\nWorse than the others: Bill Clinton: Mr. Bob Dole\nYou're too old to understand the way the game is told\nYou're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts\nWant some on lease? I'm makin' millions: niggaz top that\n\nThey wanna censor me: they'd rather see me in a cell\nLivin' in hell: only a few of us'll live to tell\nNow everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck\nI'd be the first one to bomb and cuss: nigga tell me how U want it\n\nHow do U want it? How does it feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\nHow do U want it? How do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nI'm livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\n\nRaised as a youth: tell the truth I got the scoop\nOn how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof\nBefore I was a teenager: mobile phone: Sky Pager\nGame rules: I'm livin' major: my adversaries\n\nIs lookin' worried: they paranoid of gettin' buried\nOne of us gon' see the cemetery\nMy only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive\nGettin' high: see the demons in my eyes: before I die\n\nI wanna live my life and ball: make a couple million\nAnd then I'm chillin' fade 'em all\nThese taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me\nMedia is in my business and they actin' like they know me\n\nHa ha ha: but I'mma mash out: peel out\nI'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out\nYeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it\nWhen ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it: how do U want it?\n\nHow do U want it? How does it feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\nHow do U want it? How do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\n\nHow do U want it? How does it feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\nHow do U want it? How do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nWe're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real\n\nHow do U want it?

        "Lyrics": "It doesn't matter what I say\nAs long as I sing with inflection\nThat makes you feel that I'll convey\nSome inner truth or vast reflection\n\nBut I've said nothing so far\nAnd I can keep it up for as long as it takes\nAnd it don't matter who you are\nIf I'm doing my job: it's your resolve that breaks\n\nBecause the hook brings you back\nI ain't telling you no lie\nThe hook brings you back\nOn that you can rely\n\nThere is something amiss\nI am being insincere\nIn fact: I don't mean any of this\nStill my confession draws you near\n\nTo confuse the issue: I'll refer\nTo familiar heroes from long ago\nNo matter how much Peter loved her\nWhat made the Pan refuse to grow\n\nWas that the hook brings you back\nI ain't telling you no lie\nThe hook brings you back\nOn that you can rely\n\nSuck it in: suck it in: suck it in\nIf you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn\nMake a desperate move or else you'll win\nAnd then begin to see what you're doing to me \nThis MTV is not for free\nIt's so PC it's killing me\nSo desperately I'll sing to thee of love\nSure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self\nAnd I can't keep these feelings on the shelf\nI've tried: well: no: in fact: I lied\nCould be financial suicide but I got too much pride inside\nTo hide or slide: I'll do as I'll decide\nAnd let it ride until I've died and only then shall I abide\nThis tide of catchy little tunes: of hip three-minute ditties\nI want to bust all your balloons\nI want to burn all of your cities to the ground\nI found I will not mess around unless I play\nThen hey: I will go on all day: hear what I say\nI've a prayer to pray: that's really all this was\nWhen I'm feeling stuck and need a buck\nI don't rely on luck because\n\nThe hook brings you back\nI ain't telling you no lie\nThe hook\nOn that you can rely",

Daddy slow down your flow.\nPut it on me like a G baby nice and slow.\nI need a rough neck nigga mandingo in a sec:\nWho ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back.\n\nJ: No doubt: I'm the player that you're talkin' about.\n\nL: Mmm... But do you really think that you can work it out?\n\nJ: I guarantee you shorty it's real: baby stick it out:\nHere comes the man of steel.\n\nL: Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well:\nDoin' it and doin' it and doin' it well:\nDoin' it and doin' it and doin' it well:\nJ: I represent Queens: she was raised out in Brooklyn.\n\nI'm in the mix now: searching for the right spot:\nTo hit now: get down:\n\nL: Damn my lover dig down\nYou use a rubber?\n\nJ: Damn right.\n\nL: You are my lover?\n\nJ: All night.\n\nL: The putty good to you? Word to motha?\n\nJ: Man tight.\nThe only thing left to do is climax:\nLet's make it last:\n\nL: Word we ain't goin' out like that.\nAll this time you've been telling me that you was a Don.\n\nJ: I tried to warn you girl you wouldn't listen:\nNow let's get it on.\n\nL: Mmm make me wild... don't do that.\nChill wait a minute baby let me please you back.\n\nJ: You talk good one shorty love you're makin' me sweat:\nHow a live nigga like it girl?\n\nL: Nice and wet.\nWe get it on to the break of dawn: damn your large:\nHow a big girl like it daddy?\n\nJ: Nice and hard.\nSafe sexin' it: flexin' it: gettin' mad affectionate:\nChewin' it: doin' it: all while we're doin' it.\n\nJ: Baby: I wanna hit it in the worst way.\n\nL: Make it hot.\n\nJ: Scheming on the ass since the first day.\n\nL: Don't stop.\nDamn I love it when you talk like that.\nMake it bounce sugar:\n\nJ: Long as you can bounce me back.\nMore flesh than the greek fest:\n\nL: Roll up the sess.\n\nJ: Pass the Hennessee:\n\nL: Put my body to the test.\nWay way back many niggas ago:\nI was a young girl listening to how you flow.\nNow's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown.\nFrom the back: from the side:\n\nJ: Right: I'm in the zone.\nOne of a kind when it's time to do mine.\nCamcorder and the whole shit:\n\nL: Press rewind.\nLet it flow on the screen while we puffs the L.\nLayin' back in the cut while we're under the spell.\n\nJ: Word life: I like the way the ep went down.\nGo to sleep: tomorrow I'll take you back downtown.\nWe'll be:",

        "Lyrics": "B-Boy: where the fuck you at?\nI been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.\nHot peas and butter: baby: come and get your supper.\nBefore I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a\nCan I get hot when you hit the jackpot?\nSurely I can: if you the man.\nI get loose and produce large amounts of juice.\nCan you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang\nGet it on.\nYou're gettin' warm.\nI can feel you getting closer.\nNow baby: down this Mimosa.\nYou better believe it's time to give a toast to.\nThe woman of the decade: too bad to be played.\nGet vex and I'm bound to throw shade.\nAll over your body.\nWho's body?\nYou're body.\nI can rock a party like nobody.\nLeavin' time to take home the loot.\nChoosy about who I let knock my boots.\nNow let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte.\nLife ain't all that unless you're doing it right.\n\nKeep On' Keepin' On: Cause you came and you changed my world.\nYour love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin' it right: right:\nRight... Ah: ah: ah...\n\nBeware of the stare when I step into peace.\nI come in peace but I got shit that need to be released.\nNow who from the chosen shall I choose?\nYeah: now you wish you was in his shoes.\nI found me a new nigga this year.\nThat know's how to handle this here.\nNow I look forward to goin' home at night.\nBrother does mo right.\nUnder the candlelight.\nWax upon my back: can I handle all of that?\nI guess I can.\nCan I: why not?\nIf I wanna guess I can. Can I?\nMore honey than a bumble-bee hive.\nPulling 69 ways in my archive.\nSweet like licorice.\nSugar for my booga.\nJuicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee.\nI got shit to make your ass write a bad check.\nCause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat.\nBeat on my drum if you feel the need to.\nAs I procede to Open up and feed you.\nI got a longing to put you where you wanna be.\nBeen I can: I get rid of all company.\n\nMany have tried strict regulation.\nLazy motherfuckers get put on probation.\nThose that didn't perform well.\nThey gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell.\nYou're playing with my time.\nTrying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me.\nYou better work me.\nWhile you got the oppurtunity.\nTo be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E.\nOnly the strong survive.\nOnly the wise excel.\nOnce said by my born-in-hell.\nOnly the lonely die slowly.\nLeft all alone try to control me.\nEasy does it never ask how was it.\nNever speak my info why my sheets in the streets.\nCause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute.\nTo talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot.\nBut it's all good: though you gotta get it when you want it.\nLike your prey: make your move and hop up on it.\nIt's natural. Never be ashamed.\nFuck the fame. Get the name: and kick the game.",

Yes: you promised me that you'd never leave: boy...\nBut you went away: baby: and it's such a shame;\nHow could you turn your back on me? Oh...\n\n(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me:) If you don't need me...\n(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love: boy?\n(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me:) If you don't need me...\n(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?)\n\nI gave: gave everything a man could ever need;\nI was there whenever you would call me: baby...\nBut somehow: your feelings changed: you don't act the same;\nI guess you're not the man that I once knew at all...\n\nHow you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;\nDon't you remember that you promised me? Yes: you promised me that you'd never leave: boy...\nNow the love is gone: baby - tell me what went wrong?\nHow could you leave me hanging on? Oh: baby...\n\n(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me:) Oh: oh: oh...\n(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love? Yeah...\n(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me:) If you don't need me...\n(If you really don't love me:) Tell me: yeah... (then who do you love?)

Tell me who do you love?\n\nI once was blind but: baby: now I see: yeah: (Now I see...)\nThat I'm not the one who can fill your every need... (Fill your need...)\nI painted a picture so clear: it's reality; (Reality...)\nNow I know: yes: I know: that you're not the one for me...\n\nOh: baby!\n(If you really don't want me: if you really don't need me:) Oh: yeah!\n(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?)

That shit ain't even ?? big boy\n Oh aight: you don't: you don't get none of that shit\nUh: check it out\n Bout to \"get money\"\n\n(Notorious B.I.G.)\nYou wanna sip Mo' on my living room flo'\nPlay Nintendo with Cease-a-Leo\nPick up my phone say: \"Poppa not home\"\nSex all night: mad head in the morn'\nSpin my V: smoke all my weed\nTattoo on tit-tie sayin' B-I-G: now check it\nYou wanna be my main squeeze baby\nDon'tcha: you wanna gimme what I need baby\nWon'tcha: picture life as my wife just think\nFull length mink: fat X and O links\nBracelets to match: conversation was all that\nShowed you the safe combinations and all that\nGuess you could say youse the one I trusted\nWho would ever think that you would spread like mustard?\nShit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot\nTook me to court: tried to take all I got\n'Nother intricate plot: the bitch said I raped her\n\"Damn: why she wanna stick me for my paper?\"\nMy Mo-sci-no hoe: my Ver-sa-ce hottie\nCome to find out: you was fuckin' everybody\nYou knew about me: the fake ID\nCases in Virginia: body in D.C.\nWoe: oh is me: that's what I get for trickin\nPay my own bail: commence to ass kickin\nLick in the door: wavin the four-four\nAll you heard was: \"Poppa don't hit me no more\"\nDisrespect my click: my shit's imperial\nFuck around and made her milkbox material\nYou feel me? Suckin dick: runnin' your lips\n'Cause of you: I'm on some real fuck a bitch shit: uh...\n\nFuck bitches: get money... fuck niggaz: get money \n\n WHAT? I see mad girls like you\n You seen mad girls just ACTIN' hot\n I'm tellin' you though\n There AIN'T nobody like me\n You just frontin: there's people out like that\n ??\n\n(Lil' Kim)\nUh: whoo! Get at me\nWhoo: I told you niggaz\nNiggaz... betta grab a seat\nGrab on your dick as this bitch gets deep\nDeeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet\nStiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite\nYoung bitch from the street: guaranteed to stay down\nUsed to bring work outta town on Greyhound\nNow I'm Billboard now: niggaz press to hit it\nPlay me like a chicken: thinkin' I'm pressed to get it\nRather do the killin' than the stick up jooks\nRather count a million while you eat my pussy\nPush me to the limit get my feelings in it\nGet me open while I'm cummin down your throat\nThen: you wanna be my main squeeze nigga\nDon'tcha: you wanna lick between my knees nigga\nDon'tcha wanna see me whippin your 3 down the Ave.\nBlow up spots on bitches because I'm mad\nBreak up affairs lick shots in the air\nYou get vexed: and start swingin' everywhere\nMe shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me\nPull out your nine: while I cock on mine\nYeah what nigga? I ain't got time for this\nSo what nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit\nNow you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits\nAdrienne Vitadini and Chanel 9 boots\nThings that make up: for all the games and the lies\nHallmark cards: sayin': \"I apologize\"\nIs you wit me? How could you ever deceive me\nBut payback's a bitch motherfucker: believe me\nNaw I ain't gay this ain't no lesbo flow\nJust a lil somethin': to let you motherfuckers know\n\nFuck bitches: get money... fuck niggaz: get money \n\n Wait a minute: wait a minute\nBack up: just give me that shit: this shit is mine\n Oh you want my numbers and shit\n ??\n Look: now you wanna ??\n I'm all that bitch: don't ask\nYou're fuckin' with a bitch named Aphrodite\n Y'all believe that shit?\n Just playin' with you: worrd\n?? Daddy is all that: oh word\n?? I'm talkin' bout some presidents\nTalkin' bout this motherfuckin cash\n Whatever you don't think about this\nMy nickname was Jesus in high school\n You don't even believe that shit!\nGod don't believe that shit!\n I'm the supreme being baby",

        "Lyrics": "Sittin' on a quarter 'p of hay\nThangs is feelin' good today.\nI'm tore up: from the floor up\nSippin on some crown royal.\nTrippin': in a circle of wood\nWhere everybody smoke they own bud.\nGood ole' hay\nHow you feel today?\nFine: blowed and dandy.\nSilly like I'm hype off candy.\nGotta big: thick chic named sandy.\nIn the farm in the middle of the barn\nWhere everybody's feelin' crazy.\nI went to visit granny's house.\nNow I see why don't nobody leave.\nWe constantly: constantly: constantly smokin' b's.\nToo blitzed to even shake it off\nBut I still got my head up.\nColdhard finna go in the back of the barn\nAnd get my big black peter sucked\nPass the hay you silly slut:\nBlaze it up so I can hit that bud.\nGit me zoned and I'll be on.\n'Cause I love to smoke upon hay.\n\nSmokin' on\nHay in the middle of the barn.\nSmokin' on\nHay in the middle of the barn.\n\nThe hay got me goin' through a stage\nAnd I just can't get enough.\nSmokin' everyday\nI got some hay\nAnd you know I'm finna roll it up.\nMake a cloud\nI'm gonna take my mind away from all the\nBullcrap.\nBump my sounds\nLay back and roll\nMack to the freaks that's on the road.\nSometimes I wonder\nWhen I was blowed on the streets.\nAnybody wanna step to me:\nI'ma see how rough they be.\nIn this session: manifesting\nOn myp's and q's\nNever snooze 'cause I refuse.\nInhale: exhale the smell.\nSmokin' hay all by myself.\nWildstle: laughin' loud.\nWit my homies by my side.\nIf somethin' jump off let it ride\nOn my square when time is live.\nEverybody throw it up\nGo to the barn and get some hay.\nWhen I get my choke on.\nFool you know I'm smokin' on...\n\nHay now hay\nWe smokin' up hay in the middle of the barn\nAnd I'm lit up\nCan't get up\nMy eyes are red\nAnd my head is spinnin.\nTook another pull\nRidin' red bull\nGot the goofies: can't stop grinnin.\nGot a posse full of hoes playin' in my braids\nAnd we bout to get in em.\nOver yonder is the barn where the pals be at\nAnd everything funny.\nGotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high\nSmokin' all that hay with no money.\nNow truly this bitch wanna do me\nSo I hit the 151bacardi\nShe high like the sun\nThick like cornbread: and I'm ready to party.\nThat hay got me so gotdamn horny\nBut I don't like that tramp.\nThe only reason I'm poppin' that coochie\nCause the hoe had a book of foodstamps.\nAnd I got the munchies\nI need soul food.\nCollard greens or pinto beans.\nIf you smoke hay like the conflict do:\nThen you know what the hell I mean.\n\nRollin' down the block\nCar full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack.\nGot my niggas in the barn smokin' on that\nHay stack\nBack up on the scene from smokin' herb:\nI creeped up on the wall and all I heard.\nWas a bud of mine who dropped a needle in\nThe hay\nWith a funky dime word.\nCouldn't be myself\nCouldn't smoke wit nobody else\nIf I didn't pass it to the left.\nNigga would have lost my breath.\nOpen up the window 'fore I fall and faint\nBut I can't\n'Cause I roll around in dat barn ride.\nRollin' up the hootie hoo\nRoughest skin roller on dat west side.\nNigga come on in\nI got some hay\nWon't you close dat barn door\nNigga what you let them flies out for?\nAin't nobody to rich: we poor.\nLettin all the contact smoke up in the barn\nThe flies keep us chokin.\nThank you Jesus Christ\nFor all the hay you're givin' us\n'Cause we'll keep on smokin'.",

Don't cry...\n'Cause you still be loved\nDon't cry\nDon't cry tonight\nOh...\n\nMy baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby\n...Ba da ba ba da da...\n\nMy baby my baby my my baby my baby my baby my baby mymy baby my baby my baby\n...Oh... yeyeyeyeiah... yeyeyeyeiah...\n\nMy baby...\n\nYou'll still be loved by me",
