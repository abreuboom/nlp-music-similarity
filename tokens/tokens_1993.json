        "Lyrics": "Yeah\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3-4\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1\n\nIt's called the rump shaker: the piece is like sweeter than candy\nI'm feelin' manly and you say it's comin' in handy\nSlidin' my claws from New York down by your Virginia\nTicklin' you around Delaware before I enter\nTotal seduction: from face: hips: to feet\nA wiggle and jiggle can make the night complete\nNow since you got the body of the year: come and get the award\nHere's a hint: it's like a long sharp sword\nFlip tail: so let me see you shake it up like dice\nThe way you shake your rump is turnin' mighty men to mice\nBut A+ got a surprise that's a back breaker\nNow let me see you shake your rump like a rump shaker\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3-4\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1\n\nIt's Teddy: ready with the 1-2 checker\nWreckx-N-Effect is in effect: but I'm the wrecker\nOff the track: 'bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in\nBooties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin'\nThe action is packed than a jam like the kinds of beat\nBound to get you up: cold flowin' like a faucet\nNot meant to make you sit: not meant to make you jump\nBut Jet make the hotties in the parties shake your rump\nI like the way you comb your hair: uh\nI like the stylish clothes you wear: uh\nIt's just the little things you do: uh\nThat makes me wanna get with you: uh\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nShake it: shake it: shake it: now shake it\nShe could spend every birthday butt naked\nBody and soul: makin' me wanna squish her\nMore just in the game a rumper like a sub-woofer\nShake it to the left: shake it to the right\nI don't mind stickin' it to her every single night\nCome on pass the poom-poom: send it to papa\nShake it: baby: shake it: baby: shake it: don't stoppa\nLet me see you do the booty hock: and now I'll make the booty stock\nNow drop and do the booty rock\nThe way you're shakin' your grill's really kill\nIt's makin' broth' ills up a whole lot of pills\nBut I ain't into trickin' just to treatin'\nAnd I ain't into treatin' every trick that I'm meetin'\nNo: no: no: no: no: no: no\nYeah: shake it: baby: shake it down: shake it like that\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3-4\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-1\n\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3-4\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-1\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3-4\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-1\n\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3-4\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2-3\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-2\nCheck: baby: check: baby: 1-1\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom\nJust shake your rump\nAll I wanna do is zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom and a boom-boom\nJust shake your rump\n\nBreak it down\nJust shake your rump\nWNE is in effect\nPeace\nAnd we out",

(Nights I've laid in bed excited over you)\nOoh... (One hundred different ways I've thought of)\nOoh... (Many: Many...)\nDay and night: night and day\nAll I want to say is\n\nIf I was your girl\nOh the things I'll do to you\nI'd make you call out my name\nI'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman:\nThe things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not: so I can't: and I won't\nBut: if I was your girl\n\nIf I was your girl\nOh the things I'll do to you\nI'd make you call out my name\nI'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman:\nThe things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not: so I can't: and I won't\nBut: if I was your girl\n\nIf I was your girl\nOh the things I'll do to you\nI'd make you call out my name\nI'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman:\nThe things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not...",

Will you help me down?\nWill you get me right out of this god forsaken town?\nWill you make it all a little less cold?\n\nI can do that\nOh: I can do that\n\nWill you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?\nCan you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white\nCan you make it all a little less old?\n\nI can do that\nOh woah now: I can do that\n\nWill you make me some magic with your own two hands?\nCan you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?\nCan you give me something I can take home?\n\nNow: I can do that\nOh woah now: I can do that\n\nWill you cater to every fantasy I've got?\nWill you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot: ha?\nWill you take me places I've never known?\n\nNow: I can do that\nOh woah now: I can do that\n\nAfter awhile you'll forget everything\nIt was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling\nAnd you'll see that it's time to move on\n\nI won't do that\nI won't do that\n\nI know the territory: I've been around\nIt'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down\nSooner or later: you'll be screwing around\n\nI won't do that\nNo: I won't do that\n\nAnything for love\nOh: I would do anything for love\nI would do anything for love\nBut I won't do that\nNo: I won't do that",

Again.\nSo Baby I'm yours: if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.\nAnd Baby I'm yours: if you need me. La la la.\nLoving you forever: if you want me. Give me your love.\nBaby I'm yours: if you need me. Oh...\nRealize girl that my faith is kind of torn.\nWatch your step girl: Because my heart is weak and worn.\nSo won't you please be careful: I'm fragile.\nI can't imagine the damage:\nI have to handle. If you hurt me one more time:\nPlease be mine.\nSo Baby I'm yours: if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.\nAnd Baby I'm yours: if you need me. La la la.\nLoving you forever: if you want me. Give me your love.\nBaby I'm yours: if you need me. Oh...\nBaby: I've been through a whole lot of relationships:\nWhole lot of broken promises:\nBut now I'm ready for a real one sweet heart.\nYes I am.\nYou don't have to worry baby.\nDon't you every go away.\nBaby I'm: Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm: Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm: Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm: Baby Baby I'm yours.\nBaby I'm: Baby Baby I'm yours.\nSo Baby I'm yours: if you want me. And if you want my sweet love.\nAnd Baby I'm yours: if you need me. La la la.\nLoving you forever: if you want me. Give me your love.\nBaby I'm yours: if you need me. Oh...",

Don't come around\n\nTippy tippy pause\nTippy tippy pause\nSome start creepin' up: I eat 'em up\nTheir styles are older than Lou Rawls\nPeace to this one and that one and them\nThat's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend\nFools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us\nYou could have crews with shoes and can't step to us\nSome kitty's purr\nNow call me sir too\nLookin' for her crew\nAny trick that diss gets a curfew\nI put on projects for boots\nStep through troops and leave proof\nMy problem solver name is Mook\nI'm hittin' woodies in a hoody\nPeace to Jesette: Jobete: Jo-Jo: Jenae and every hood Gee\nThat's right: my fight is ill\nPeace goes to L.O.N.S & Quest: Nice and Smooth and Cypress Hill\n\nI live and die for Hip Hop\nThis is Hip Hop of today\nI give props to Hip Hop\nSo Hip Hop Hooray: ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho\nHip Hop Hooray: ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho\n\nSmooth it out now",

Right here\nKiss both your lips and rubin' those thighs\nTaste your wine\nLet me taste you baby: ah\n\nI can do it soft or I can do it hard\nI can make you scream if you let down your guard my baby\nIt's not too far from here to extasy\nI know you want good lovin'\nSo lay your body next to me\n\nIf ain't good enough: good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumping every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up: do you up baby\nAnd I will not start till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough: good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumpin every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up: do you up baby\nAnd I will not stop till I know you're hot\n\nSlow moving in your body\nFeels like I'm gonna be in here all night\nAnd when the love is rolling\nStart coming without stop\nFilled to the brim\nI'm gonna trip down to the very last drop\n\nAnd if ain't good enough for you baby\nI'll do it all for you\nAnd I will not stop till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough: good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumping every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up: do you up baby\nAnd I will not start till I know you're hot\n\nIf ain't good enough then I'll work harder\nTurn it up I'll please you darlin'\nDo it up: do it up just for you\nAnd baby I'll taste the wine and give you pleasure\nClose the door I'll do whatever\nTill I know you're hot\n\nIf ain't good enough: good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumping every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up: do you up baby\nAnd I will not start till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough: good enough baby\nI'll work harder\nPumpin every minute girl\nAnd baby I'll do you up: do you up baby\nAnd I will not stop till I know you're hot\nIf ain't good enough: good enough baby...",

I get around\nThe Underground just don't stop for hoes: I get around\nStill down with the Underground: I get around\nYeah: ayo Shock: let them hoes know\n\n(Shock G)\nNow you can tell from my everday fits: I ain't rich\nSo cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)\nI'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)\nTrying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)\nJust 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets\nBaby I can see: that you don't recognize me\nI'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties\nNever knew a hooker that could share me: I get around\n\n(Money B)\nWhat's up love: how you doing? (All right)\nWell I've been hanging sanging: trying to do my thang\nOh: you heard that I was banging\nYour home girl you went to school with: that's cool\nBut did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't\nSee: weekends were made for Michelob\nBut it's a Monday: my day: so just let me hit it: yo\nAnd don't mistake my statement for a clown\nWe can keep in the down low long as you know: that I get around\n\n(Tupac)\n2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes: I get around\nWhy I ain't call you? Ha ha: please\n\nFinger tips on the hips as I dip: gotta get a tight grip: don't slip\nLoose lips sink ships: it's a trip\nI love the way she licks her lips: see me jocking\nPut a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watching\nConversations on the phone till the break of dawn\nNow we all alone: why the lights on?\nTurn 'em off: time to set it off: get you wet and soft\nSomething's on your mind: let it off\nYou don't know me: you just met me: you won't let me\nWell if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?\nIt's a lot of real G's doing time\nCause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie\nYou picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly\nYou need to hit the door: search for a new guy\n'Cause I only got one night in town\nBreak out or be clown: baby doll are you down?\nI get around\n\n(Shock G)\nRound and round: round we go (Repeat 8x)",

I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\n\nOoh: when I met you I just knew that\nYou would take my heart and run\nUntil you told me how you felt for me\nYou said I'm not the one\nSo I slowly came to see\nAll of the things that you were made of\nAnd now I hope my dreams and inspirations\nLead me toward some real love\n\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\n\nI got to have a real love\n\nLoves so true and oh baby\nI thought that love was you\nI thought you were the answer to\nThe question in my mind\nBut it seems that I was wrong\nIf I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love\n\nSo I try my best and pray to God\nHe'll send me someone real\nTo caress me and to guide me towards\nThe love my heart can feel\nNow I know I can be faithful\nI can be your all in all\nI'll give you good luvin' through the summer time\nWinter: spring: and fall\n\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\n\nYou see I'm searching for a real love\nAnd I don't know where to go\nBeen around the world and high and low\nAnd still I'll never know\nHow it feels to have a real love\n'Cause it seems it's not around\nGotta end it in this way because it\nSeems he can't be found\n\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love",

Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'\nThinking \"Will I live another twenty-fo'?\"\n\nI gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top\nAnd if I hit the switch: I can make the ass drop\nHad to stop at a red light\nLooking in my mirror: not a jacker in sight\nAnd everything is alright\nI got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night\n\nCalled up the homies and I'm askin y'all\n\"Which court are y'all playin' basketball?\"\nGet me on the court and I'm trouble\nLast week: fucked around and got a triple double\nFreaking niggas every way like M.J.\nI can't believe today was a good day (Shit)\n\nDrove to the pad and hit the showers\nDidn't even get no static from the cowards\n'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me\nSaw the police and they rolled right past me\n\nNo flexin': didn't even look in a nigga's direction\nAs I ran the intersection\nWent to Short Dog's house: they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps\nWhat's the haps on the craps?\n\nShake 'em up: shake 'em up: shake 'em up: shake 'em\nRoll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em\nWith the seven: seven-eleven: seven-eleven\nSeven even back do' Little Joe\n\nI picked up the cash flow\nThen we played bones and I'm yellin' \"Domino!\"\nPlus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.\nToday was a good day (Shit)\n\nLeft my nigga's house paid (What)\nPicked up a girl I been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade\nIt's ironic: I had the brew she had the chronic\nThe Lakers beat the SuperSonics\n\nI felt on the big fat fanny\nPulled out the jammy and killed the punanny\nAnd my dick runs deep: so deep: so deep\nPut her ass to sleep\n\nWoke her up around one\nShe didn't hesitate: to call Ice Cube \"The Top Gun\"\nDrove her to the pad and I'm coasting\nTook another sip of the potion: hit the three-wheel motion\n\nI was glad everything had worked out\nDropped her ass off and then chirped out\nToday was like one of those fly dreams\nDidn't even see a berry flashing those high beams\n\nNo helicopter looking for a murder\nTwo in the morning: got the fat burger\nEven saw the lights of the Goodyear blimp\nAnd it read \"Ice Cube's a pimp.\" (Yeah)\n\nDrunk as hell but no throwing up\nHalfway home and my pager still blowing up\nToday: I didn't even have to use my AK\nI got to say: it was a good day (Shit)\n\nHey wait: wait a minute: Pooh\nStop this shit\nWhat the fuck I'm thinking about?",

What's wrong?\nYou're not concentrating\nYes: I am concentrating\nNo: you're not\nI'm sorry: let's just do it again\nNonono: uh uh. What's the problem\nThere's no problem.\nDawn: what's wrong?\nThere's nothing wrong: Terry.\nKevin.\nMmhm\nPlease don't tell me it's Kevin.\nMmhm\nEw: Kevin Swahili: I knew it! He's got cooties.\nAnd he's seeing Tamika right now\nAnd everybody else\nHe is not seeing Raneka\nHe is.\nHow you know?\nWait a minute guys.\nWait wait wait. You guys: we should not attack her: it sounds like it's\nSerious because we can't concentrate and get this right. So: let's deal with\nThe problem.\nYou see: I've been through this myself: and: let's talk.\nAnd it goes a little something like this - hit it.\nMmm...\n\nBaby girl (unfair but true)\nCan love him once but not twice\nWho plays games with no rules (a fool)\nTears for fears (are no surprise)\nHappens almost every time\nLove knocks you on your behind\n(Loved you hard: loved you long: now his love is gone)\nLove 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)\nYou must be strong\nStand up on your own\nTake control of your life\nI've seen it time and time again\nIt's not worth it: no\nDon't be down and miserable\nYou and only you\nCan bring yourself around\n\nGive it up: turn it loose\nOh: if it don't wantcha: you don't need 'em: girl: yeah\nGive it up: turn it loose\nOh: you got to have\n\nFact of life (so sad but true)\nLove can often hurt you\nLeaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)\nBut fairytales of love: can come true\nBoth play tricks on your mind\n(You'll be fine: take this time: to find piece of mind)\nSooner or later (bad feelings will die)\nYou must be strong\nDon't blame it all on love\nIn time good things will come\nI've seen time and time again\nIt's not worth it: no no\nDon't be down and miserable\nYou and only you\nCan bring yourself around\n\nGive it up: turn it loose\nOh: if it don't wantcha: you don't need 'em: girl... yeah\nGive it up: turn it loose\nOh: you got to have\n(Give it up)\nGive it up\n(Give up)\nGive it up\n(Give up)\nGive it up\nGive it up turn it loose\nTurnin' it loose: baby\n(Repeat till fade)",
