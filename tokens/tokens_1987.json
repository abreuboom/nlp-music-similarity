        "Lyrics": "Clock strikes upon the hour\nAnd the sun begins to fade\nStill enough time to figure out\nHow to chase my blues away\nI've done all right up to now\nIt's the light of day that shows me how\nAnd when the night falls: loneliness calls\n\nOh: I wanna dance with somebody\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\nYeah: I wanna dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nOh: I wanna dance with somebody\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\nYeah: I wanna dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nI've been in love and lost my senses\nSpinning through the town\nSooner or later: the fever ends\nAnd I wind up feeling down\n\nI need a man who'll take a chance\nOn a love that burns hot enough to last\nSo when the night falls\nMy lonely heart calls\n\nOh: I wanna dance with somebody\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\nYeah: I wanna dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nOh: I wanna dance with somebody\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\nYeah: I wanna dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nSomebody ooh: somebody ooh\nSomebody who loves me yeah\nSomebody ooh: somebody ooh\nTo hold me in his arms oh\n\nI need a man who'll take a chance\nOn a love that burns hot enough to last\nSo when the night falls\nMy lonely heart calls\n\nOh: I wanna dance with somebody\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\nYeah: I wanna dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nOh: I wanna dance with somebody\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\nYeah: I wanna dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nDon't ya wanna dance with me baby\nDon't ya wanna dance with me boy\nHey don't ya wanna dance with me baby\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nDon't ya wanna dance: say you wanna dance: don't ya wanna dance\nDon't ya wanna dance: say you wanna dance: don't ya wanna dance\nDon't ya wanna dance: say you wanna dance\nWith somebody who loves me\nDance",

My face is red\nI stand corrected (I stand corrected)\n\nYou've got the look: you've got the hook\nSho'nuff do be cookin' in my book\nYour face is jammin': your body's heck-a-slammin'\nIf love is good: let's get to rammin'\nYou got the look: you got the look\n\nThere's no jokin' you\nWell: here we are\nLadies and gentlemen\nThe dream we all dream of (oh: please)\nBoy versus girl in the World Series of love\nSlammin'\n\nYou walked in (I walked in): I woke up (you woke up)\nI never seen such a pretty girl look so tough\nBaby (Baby): you got that look (yes you do)\n\nColor you peach and black\nColor me takin' aback: baby\nCrucial: think I want'cha\n\nYou've got the look: you've got the hook\nSho'nuff do be cookin' in my book\nYour face is jammin': your body's heck-a-slammin'\nIf love is good: let's get to rammin' now\nYou got the look: you got the look\n\nHere we are folks: the dream we all dream of\nYou got the look\nYou got the look\nYou got the look\nYou got the look\nYou got the look",

        "Lyrics": "Full moon in the city\nAnd the night was young\nI was hungry for love\nI was hungry for fun\n\nI was hunting you down\nAnd I was the bait\nWhen I saw you there\nI didn't mean to hesitate\n\nThis is the night\nThis is the night\nThis is the time we've got to get it right\n\n(This is the night)\nTouch me: touch me\nI want to feel your body\nYour heart beat next to mine\n(This is the night)\nTouch me: touch me now\n\nQuick as a flash you disappeared into the night\nDid I hurt you boy?\nDidn't I treat you right?\nYou made me feel so good\nMade me feel myself\nNow I'm alone and you're with somebody else\n\nThis is the night: yeah\nThis is the night\nThis is the time we've got to get it right\n\n(This is the night)\nTouch me: touch me\nI want to feel your body\nYour heart beat next to mine\n(This is the night)\nTouch me: touch me now\nTouch me: touch me now\nTouch me: touch me now\n\nHot and cold emotions confusing my brain\nI could not decide between pleasure and pain\nLike a tramp in the night\nI was begging for you\nTo treat my body like you wanted to\n\nUh...\nUh: it's begging for you\n\n(This is the night)\nTouch me: touch me\nI want to feel your body\nYour heart beat next to mine\n(This is the night)\n'Cause I want your body all the time\n\n(This is the night)\nTouch me: touch me\nI want to feel your body\nYour heart beat next to mine\n(This is the night)\n'Cause I want your body all the time",

        "Lyrics": "It's all the same: only the names will change\nEvery day: it seems we're wasting away\nAnother place where the faces are so cold\nI'd drive all night just to get back home\n\nI'm a cowboy: on a steel horse I ride\nI'm wanted: dead or alive\nWanted: dead or alive\n\nSometimes I sleep: sometimes it's not for days\nThe people I meet always go their separate ways\nSometimes you tell the day\nBy the bottle that you drink\nAnd times when you're alone: all you do is think\n\nI'm a cowboy: on a steel horse I ride\nI'm wanted (wanted): dead or alive\nWanted (wanted): dead or alive\n\nOh: and I ride\n\nYeah\n\nI'm a cowboy: on a steel horse I ride\nI'm wanted (wanted): dead or alive\n\nAnd I walk these streets: a loaded six string on my back\nI play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back\nI've been everywhere (oh yeah) still I'm standing tall\nI've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all\n\n'Cause I'm a cowboy: on a steel horse I ride\nI'm wanted (wanted): dead or alive\n\nAnd I'm a cowboy: I got the night on my side\nAnd I'm wanted (wanted): dead or alive\n\nAnd I ride (and I ride) dead or alive\nI still drive (I still drive) dead or alive\nDead or alive\nDead or alive\nDead or alive\nDead or alive",

        "Lyrics": "If I had to live my life without you near me\nThe days would all be empty\nThe nights would seem so long\nWith you I see forever oh so clearly\nI might have been in love before\nBut it never felt this strong\nOur dreams are young and we both know\nThey'll take us where we want to go\nHold me now: touch me now\nI don't want to live without you\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nOne thing you can be sure of\nI'll never ask for more than your love\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nThe world may change my whole life through\nBut nothing's gonna change my love for you\n\nIf the road ahead is not so easy\nOur love will lead the way for us\nLike a guiding star\nI'll be there for you if you should need me\nYou don't have to change a thing\nI love you just the way you are\nSo come with me and share the view\nI'll help you see forever too\nHold me now: touch me now\nI don't want to live without you\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nOne thing you can be sure of\nI'll never ask for more than your love\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nThe world may change my whole life through\nBut nothing's gonna change my love for you\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nOne thing you can be sure of\nI'll never ask for more than your love\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nOne thing you can be sure of\nI'll never ask for more than your love\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nThe world may change my whole life through\nBut nothing's gonna change my love for you\n\nNothing's gonna change my love for you\nYou ought to know by now how much I love you\nOne thing you can be sure of\nI'll never ask for more than your love\n(Fade)",
