        "Lyrics": "&#x2014; Excuse me. Can I please talk to you for a minute?\n&#x2014; Uh huh: sure. You know: you look kinda familiar\n&#x2014; Yeah: you do too... but um: I just wanted to know: do you know somebody named... you know his name\n&#x2014; Oh yeah: definitely. I know his name\n&#x2014; I just want to let you know that he's mine\n&#x2014; Heh... no no. He's mine\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough\nIt's not hard to see\nThe boy is mine\n\nI think it's time we got this straight\nLet's sit and talk face to face\nThere is no way you could mistake\nHim for your man: are you insane?\n\nSee I know that you may be\nJust a bit jealous of me\nBut you're blind if you can't see\nThat his love is all in me\n\nSee I tried to hesitate\nI didn't want to say what he told me\nHe said without me he couldn't make\nIt through the day: ain't that a shame?\n\nWell: maybe you misunderstood\n'Cause I can't see how he could\nWanna change something that's so good\nAll of my love was all it took (The boy is mine)\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough (enough)\nIt's not hard to see\nThe boy is mine (boy is mine)\n\nI'm sorry that you (sorry that you)\nSeem to be confused (confused)\nHe belongs to me\nThe boy is mine\n\nMust you do the things you do\nYou keep on acting like a fool\nYou need to know it's me: not you\nAnd if you didn't know it girl: it's true\n\nI think that you should realize\nTry to understand why\nHe is a part of my life\nI know it's killing you inside\n\nYou can say what you wanna say\nWhat we have that you can't take\nFrom the truth: you can't escape\nI can tell the real from the fake\n\nWhen will you get the picture?\nYou're the past and I'm the future\nAnyway: it's my time to shine\nIf you didn't know: the boy is mine (The boy is mine)\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough (had about enough)\nIt's not hard to see (to see)\nThe boy is mine (that the boy is mine)\n\nI'm sorry that you (sorry that you)\nSeem to be confused (seem to be confused)\nHe belongs to me (he belongs to me)\nThe boy is mine\n\nYou can't destroy this love I've found\nYour silly games I won't allow\nThe boy is mine without a doubt\nYou might as well throw in the towel\n\nWhat makes you think that he wants you\nWhen I'm the one that brought him to\nThe special places in my heart\nHe was my lover from the start\n\nYou need to give it up\nHad about enough\nIt's not hard to see\nThe boy is mine\n\nYou need to give it up (you need to give it up)\nHad about enough (about enough)\nIt's not hard to see (it's not hard to see)\nThe boy is mine (the boy is mine)\n\nI'm sorry that you\nSeem to be confused (seem to be confused)\nHe belongs to me (he belongs to me)\nThe boy is mine (the boy is mine)\n\nYou need to give it up (not yours &#x2014; but mine)\nHad about enough (not yours &#x2014; but mine)\nIt's not hard to see (not yours &#x2014; but mine)\nThe boy is mine\n\nI'm sorry that you\nSeem to be confused\nHe belongs to me\nThe boy is mine",

        "Lyrics": "New York to the heart but got love for all\nLie and die in the fire where I learned to ball\nUptown is the place where I lay my dome\nOn the streets of the Bronx where my family roam\nHoe: damn it: we home: Peter got a nine millimeter\nPlaya haters can feel the flame from my heater\nI never really liked to play a fool like that\nBut I love to succeed and see foes fall flat\nSplat like Deja Vu\nAnd I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew\nI sip Cristal: Don P: Mo' with pistol\nJust 'cause I'm pissy: don't mean you should mis doubt\nKeep 'em near da fifties and hundreds all arranged\nAnything less than that: you keep the change\nNot filthy rich but bitch: I'm barely broke\nBlessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope\nFriends call me Gunz: sons call me Trife\n'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife\nAnd that's life: you should learn how to treat her\nI guarantee: Peter knows how to eat her and beat her\nNiggaz in the Bronx call me Lex\n'Cause I push a Lex and I rock a Rolex\nAnd I lounge on Lex' and I love sex\nAnd I wave techs on sets that be tryin' to flex\nLike Dex: nigga: God rest your soul\nBut when you're playin' cards for Gunz: it ain't time to fold: hoe\n\nNew York niggaz got crazy game\nBut outta town niggaz is all the same\nBrooklyn niggaz get crazy loot\nThat's because when it's beef: they ain't scared to shoot\nHarlem niggaz know how to play\nMack the 600: gettin' crazy pay\nNiggaz outta Queens got shit on lock\nStrapped with the glock: runnin' up in yo' spot\n\nBut if it wasn't for the Bronx\nThis rap shit probably never would be going on\nSo tell me where you from? Uptown: baby: uptown: baby\nWe gets down: baby: up for the crown: baby\nWe gets down: baby: up for the crown: baby\n\nYo: the RM 80 is parked in the lot\nRight next to the Mercedes: keep the heat cocked\nFor these blocks that are shady: you're crazy if you walk around\nThinking shit's gravy: stop me? Maybe\nI'm livin' life lawless: makin' big investments\nOn them 8 class flawless and hoes call us\nI'm comfortable like Ricarro: two quarters of my life\nWalkin' roads: type: narrow: deep thoughts which I abide by\nPuffin' high: got my mind's eye: points sharper\nThan an arrow gettin' high: keep your eye on the sparrow\nRiches like the Pharaoh: bought a new five\nWith the snitches for these hoes: trunk full of ammo\nKeep my toast closer than most niggaz keep they own shadow\nAnd I strap for my foes like a saddle\nI rock stones: other niggaz rock gravel\nTalk shit? Whatever have you: I'm from Soundview\nBronx most wanted: front get confronted\nPlaya: we rollin' deep in the one point five hundreds\nLike Big I.: red eyed: mad blunted\nYou step outside and get blooded: have your whole block flooded\nWith the Bronx: it's a warnin': stormin' guns out\nFrom: 'Dusk Till Dawn' and it's on: no doubt\nKeep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin' about\nAnd put a eye on yo' lip: nigga: watch yo' mouth\nI'm from the Bronx: wipe yo' feet when you step in my house\n'Cause you'se a small-time nigga: 'bout a half an ounce now\n\nNew York niggaz got crazy game\nBut outta town niggaz is all the same\nBrooklyn niggaz get crazy loot\nThat's because when it's beef: they ain't scared to shoot\nHarlem niggaz know how to play\nMack the 600: gettin' crazy pay\nNiggaz outta Queens got shit on lock\nStrapped with the glock: runnin' up in yo' spot\n\nBut if it wasn't for the Bronx\nThis rap shit probably never would be going on\nSo tell me where you from? Uptown: baby: uptown: baby\nWe gets down: baby: up for the crown: baby\nWe gets down: baby: up for the crown: baby\n\nPeter Gunz like what? The Lord Tariq is like what?\nSoundview like what? One-seventy-fourth like what?\nMoney Boss like what? The Gun Runners like what?\nAnd KNS like what? And Uptown like what?\n\nShaolin: play: play on\nStrong Isle: play: play on and a\nMt. Vern: play play on\nAnd Yonkers: play play on and a\nPuttin' it down for N.Y.: ya know what I mean?\nN.Y. and world wide",

Well: you soon will\nI have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve\nI have a history of taking off my shirt\n\nIt's been one week since you looked at me\nThrew your arms in the air and said: \"You're crazy\"\nFive days since you tackled me\nI still got the rug burns on both my knees\n\nIt's been three days since the afternoon\nYou realized it's not my fault: not a moment too soon\nYesterday: you'd forgiven me\nAnd now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry\n\nChickity China: the Chinese chicken\nYou have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'\nWatchin' X-Files with no lights on\nWe're dans la maison (Dans la maison: la maison: la maison)\nI hope the Smoking Man's in this one\n\nLike Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic\nLike Sting I'm tantric\nLike Snickers: guaranteed to satisfy\nLike Kurosawa: I make mad films\n'Kay: I don't make films\nBut if I did they'd have a samurai\n\nGonna get a set of better clubs\nGonna find the kind with tiny nubs\nJust so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing\nGotta get in tune with Sailor Moon\n'Cause the cartoon has got the boom anime babes\nThat make me think the wrong thing\n\nHow can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?\nTryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad\nI'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral\nCan't understand what I mean? You soon will\nI have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve\nI have a history of losing my shirt\n\nIt's been one week since you looked at me\nDropped your arms to your sides and said: \"I'm sorry\"\nFive days since I laughed at you\nAnd said: \"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do\"\n\nThree days since the living room\nWe realized we're both to blame: but what could we do?\nYesterday: you just smiled at me\n'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry\n\nIt'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry\nIt'll still be two days 'til we say wasabi\nBirchmount Stadium: home of the Robbie",

You all grown up now...\n\nDoin' ya singin' thing the charts sewed up now\nWell you know I do my rap thing: I'm holdin' it down\nAnd I knew that me and you was gon' connect some how\nYour people called for this track: it ain't no trouble to me\nI dreamt that you and me got married on the WB\nYou on channel 11; I carry the M-11\nRJ the reverened; it's a match made in heaven\nWhatever have you I let you know\nI'm from soundview\nDown till I found you\nI'm tryin' to be around you\nI'm still comin' up\nChasin' the fame and wealth\nI could spoil you with time; you got everything else\n\nI'm still New York to the heart\nBut got love for all\nWhen I first saw this girl\nThought I wanted to fall\nMean the hummer so stunnin'\nThat my bod was tense\nAnd I wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince\nThen I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6\nWith Tatyana Ali playin'\nI heard Steely Dan \"Black Cow\" and went wild\nYou tell me how can I get down\nThat's when they threw me on the redeye to LA\nI dirtied my cash and peeps back\nAnd hit Shaq on the cellay\nCourtside seats so close that we could touch\nTatyana and Lord and Peter Gunz\n\nAll day long I think of you\nI can't even think of things to do\nWishin' all of my daydreams come true\nNow: baby: what am I to do?",

(It's a cruel: cruel)\n\nIt's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer\nLeaving me: leaving me here on my own\nIt's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer\nNow you're gone: you're not the only one\n\nIt's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer\nLeaving me: leaving me here on my own\nIt's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer\nNow you're gone: you're not the only one\n\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\n\nIt's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer\nLeaving me: leaving me here on my own\nIt's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer\nNow you're gone: you're not the only one\n\nIt's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer\nLeaving me: leaving me here on my own\nIt's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer\nNow you're gone: you're not the only one\n\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\n\nIt's a cruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\n\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nCruel summer\nIt's a cruel summer\nCruel summer",

Tell me...\n\nHow could you be so cold to me when I gave you everything?\nAll my love: all I had inside\nHow could you just walk out the door?\nHow could you not love me anymore?\nI thought we had forever\nI can't understand\n\nHow could the one I shared my dreams with take my dreams from me?\nHow could the love that brought such pleasure bring such misery?\nWon't somebody tell me?\nSomebody tell me please\nIf you love me: how could you do that to me?\nTell me... (Whoa-oh-oh: hey hey: hey hey: mm mm: yeah yeah)\n\nHow could you just walk out the door?\nHow could you not love me anymore?\nI thought we had forever\nI can't understand...\nNo: I can't understand\n\nHow could the one I gave my heart to break my heart so bad?

(So I can understand)\nIf you love me: how could you hurt me like that? (How could you hurt me?)\n\nHow could the one I gave my world to throw my world away? (Throw my world away)\nHow could the one who said \"I love you\" (You said you loved me: but you didn't love me) say the things you say?\nHow could the one I was so true to (Yeah: you did) just tell me lies?

That's right: sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do: do for love\nYou tried everything: but you don't give up\n\nWhat you won't do: do for love\nYou tried everything: but you don't give up\n\nJust when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy\nYou try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy\nDon't wanna fall for it: but in this case what could I do?\nSo now I'm back\nTo makin' promises to you: tryin' to keep it true\nWhat if I'm wrong: a trick to keep me holdin' on\nTryin' to be strong and in the process: keep you goin'\nI'm bout to lose my composure: I'm gettin' close\nTo packin up and leavin' notes: and gettin' ghost\nTell me who knows: a peaceful place where I can go\nTo clear my head I'm feelin' low: losin control\nMy heart is sayin' leave: oh what a tangle web we weave\nWhen we conspire to conceive: and now\nYou gettin' calls at the house: guess you cheatin'\nThat's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin': I'm out the do'\nNever no more will you see me: this is the end\nCause now I know you've been cheatin': I'm a sucka for love\n... Damn: sucka for love... sucka for love\n... Sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do: do for love\nYou tried everything: but you don't give up\n\nNow he left you with scars\nTears on your pillow and you still stay\nAs you sit and pray: hoping the beatings'll go away\nIt wasn't always a hit and run relationship\nIt use to be love: happieness and companionship\nRemember when I treated you good\nI moved you up to hills: out the ills of the ghetto hood\nMe and you a happy home: when it was on\nI had a love to call my own\nI shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost\nTrapped in your eyes\nPreoccupied with gettin' tossed: no need to lie\nYou had a man and I knew it: you told me\nDon't worry 'bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure\nMake a decision 'cause I'm waitin: when I'm alone\nI'm on the phone havin' secret conversations: huh\nI wanna take your misery: replace it with happiness\nBut I need your faith in me: I'm a sucka for love\n... Sucka for love\nKnow you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do: do for love\nYou tried everything: but you don't give up\n\n... I'ma sucka for love: sucka for love\n... Sucka for love\n\nWhat you won't do: do for love\nYou tried everything: but you don't give up\n\nWhat you won't do: do for love\nYou tried everything: but you don't give up",

        "Lyrics": "This is going out to the whole wide Westside:\nKnow what I'm sayin': yeah:\nBrake it down for me:\nSteady mop rock: rock on\n\nI was just a young boy living the hood city (eastside Compton G)\nBack in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy had every nigga talkin' about\nBoy you can't fuck with me remember Ice T had the power (oh: we)\nHear gunshots Llickin by the hour\nWith Too short bumpin every supersport and\nTaught us all how to ride for the West coast\n\nTo my people's if you wit me where you at\nThrow your dubs in the air\nWave them like you just don't care\nFrom L.A. to the bay what's ya say\nAll day every day any damn day\nTake a look around we got the whole world locked down\nGoing on and on and don't stop won't stop: can't stop either ride or die\nThat's why I put it down for the Westside\n\nDidn't seem that long ago (oh: no)\nWe were stealin 40's out the liquor store (oh: no)\nMomma started trippin' so it's time to go\nOut to the park wit the locsters (huh)\nEverybody broke smokin' roaches.\nD.J. Quick was the shit had every nigga claming\nHe was from the CPT\nYa remember one time tried to clown\nWe had to burn this bitch on down.\n\nOne time for niggas in incarceration\nI blaze a dime for you for havin' lots of patience\nTwo times for my sisters at the county building\nI got some westside love for all your ghetto children\nThree times for my niggas that have passed away\nI tip some gin for you and pray for better days\nOne day everything's going to be fine:\nBut until that day my only reply is Westside till I die.\n\nTo my people's if you wit me where you at\nThrow your dubs in the air and\nWave them like you just don't care\nFrom L.A. to the bay what's ya say\nAll day every day any damn day\nTake a look around we got the whole world locked down\nGoing on and on and don't stop won't stop: can't stop either ride or die\nGot to give it up to the Westside.\n\nFrom Crenshaw to Foothill Boulevard all I see is\nLow low's in my cars: Daytons and Five stars\nAll the true hoes is hittin switches and\nAll the finest riches of course the bombest bitches don't get it\nTwisted.\nAsk me what's a real G: show me a nigga scraping back\nAgainst the wall until his knuckles bleed. (knuckles bleed)\nScreaming death to all my enemies\nAnd those who don't believe\nWestcoast living be the shit to me\n\nOne time for niggas in incarceration\nI blaze a dime for you for havin' lots of patience\nTwo times for my sisters at the county building\nI got some westside love for all your ghetto children\nThree times for my niggas that have passed away\nI tip some gin for you and pray for better days\nOne day everything's going to be fine:\nBut until that day my only reply: is Westside till I die.\n\nTo my people's if you wit me where you at\nThrow your dubs in the air\nWave them like you just don't care\nFrom L.A. to the bay whatcha say\nAll day every day any damn day (any danm day)\nTake a look around we got the whole world locked down\nGoing on and on (and on and on) and don't stop won't stop: can't stop\nThe ride or die: Gotta give it up to the Westside\n\nTo my people's if you wit me where you at\nThrow your dubs in the air\nWave them like you just don't care\nFrom L.A. to the bay whatcha say\nAll day every day any damn day\nTake a look around we got the whole world locked down\nGoing on and on and don't stop won't stop: can't stop\nEither ride or die: la da-da-da da da da-da (da-da)\n\nTo my people's if you wit me where you at\nThrow your dubs in the air\nWave them like you just don't care\nFrom L.A. to the bay whatcha say\nAll day every day any damn day\nTake a look around we got the whole world locked down\nGoing on and on and don't stop won't stop: can't stop\nThe ride or die: TQ gon give it up for the Westside.\n\nTo my people's if you wit me where you at\nThrow your dubs in the air\nWave them like you just don't care\nFrom L.A. to the bay whatcha say\nAll day every day any damn day\nTake a look around we got the whole world locked down\nGoing on and on and don't stop won't stop: can't stop\nThe ride or die: gotta give it up for the westside\n\nDedicated to Eric \"Eazy E\" Wright: Tupac Shakur\nRest in Peace... homies.",
