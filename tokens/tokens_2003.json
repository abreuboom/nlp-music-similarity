I thought that you'd be happy I made it\nI'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life\nYou that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?\n\nWhen my jaws get to bumpin' in da club it's on\nI wink my eye at your bitch: if she smiles she gone\nIf the roof on fire: let the motherfucker burn\nIf you talking 'bout money: homie: I ain't concerned\n\nI'm-a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up\nIf the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up\nOr we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub\nThey know where we fuckin' be\n\nYou find me in da club: bottle full of bub\nLook: mami: I got the X: if you into takin' drugs\nI'm into havin' sex: I ain't into makin' love\nSo come give me a hug: if you into getting rubbed\n\nYou find me in da club: bottle full of bub\nLook: mami: I got the X: if you into takin' drugs\nI'm into havin' sex: I ain't into makin' love\nSo come give me a hug: if you into getting rubbed\n\nDon't try to act like you ain't know where we been either: nigga\nIn the club all the time: nigga: it's about to pop off: nigga\nG-Unit",

Look at what you did to me\nThey assure me: don't even need to buy a new dress\nIf you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress\n\nThe way that you know what I thought I knew\nIt's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you\nBut I still don't understand\nJust how the love you're doing no one else can\n\nGot me looking so crazy right now: your love's\nGot me looking so crazy right now (in love)\nGot me looking so crazy right now: your touch\nGot me looking so crazy right now (your touch)\nGot me hoping you'll page me right now: your kiss\nGot me hoping you'll save me right now\nLooking so crazy in love's\nGot me looking: got me looking so crazy in love\nI'm looking so crazy in love's\nGot me looking: got me looking so crazy in love\n\n'Jay-Z'\nCheck it: let's go\nYoung Hov y'all know when the flow is loco\nYoung B and the R-O-C: uh oh\nOl' G: big homie: the one and only\nStick bony: but the pocket is fat like Tony\n\nSoprano: The ROC handle like Van Exel\nI shake phoneys man: you can't get next to\nThe genuine article: I do not sing though\nI sling dough: If anything I bling yo\n\nA star like Ringo: war like a green beret\nYou crazy? Bring ya whole set\nJay-Z in the range: crazy and deranged\nThey can't figure 'I'm out they like hey is he insane\n\nYes sir I'm cut from a different cloth\nMy texture is the best fur: chinchilla\n(No no)\nBeen dealing with chain smokers\nBut how you think I got the name Hova?\n(No no)\nI been realer the game's over\n(No no)\nFall back young: ever since the label changed over\n(No no)\nTo platinum the game's been wrap: one\n\nGot me looking: so crazy: my baby\nI'm not myself: lately I'm foolish: I don't do this\nI've been playing myself: baby I don't care\n'Cause your love's got the best of me\nAnd baby you're making a fool of me\nYou got me sprung and I don't care who sees\n'Cause baby you got me: you got me: you got me so crazy baby\nHey\n\nGot me looking so crazy right now: your love's\nGot me looking so crazy right now (in love)\nGot me looking so crazy right now: your touch\nGot me looking so crazy right now (your touch)\nGot me hoping you'll page me right now: your kiss\nGot me hoping you'll save me right now\nLooking so crazy in love's\nGot me looking: got me looking so crazy in love\n\nGot me looking so crazy right now: your love's\nGot me looking so crazy right now (in love)\nGot me looking so crazy right now: your touch\nGot me looking so crazy right now (your touch)\nGot me hoping you'll page me right now: your kiss\nGot me hoping you'll save me right now\nLooking so crazy in love's\nGot me looking: got me looking so crazy in love",

        "Lyrics": "New York City \nYou are now riding\nWith 50 Cent\nYou gotta love it\n\nI just wanna chill and twist a lot\nCatch stunts in my 7-45\nYou drive me crazy: shorty I\nNeed to see you and feel you next to me\n\nI provide everything you need and I\nLike your smile: I don't wanna see you cry\nGot some questions that I gotta ask and I\nHope you can come up with the answers babe\n\nGirl: it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\nGirl: it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me? Girl\n\nIf I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?\nIf I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?\nIf I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century\nCould I count on you to be there to support me mentally?\n\nIf I went back to a hoopty from a Benz\nWould you poof and disappear like some of my friends?\nIf I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?\nIf it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?\n\nI'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive\nI'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside\nIf I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers in Burger King\nWould you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?\n\nAnd in the bed if I use my tongue: would you like that?\nIf I wrote you a love letter would you write back?\nNow we can have a li'l drink you know a nightcap\nAnd we can go do what you like: I know you like that\n\nGirl: it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me?\n\nGirl: it's easy to love me now\nWould you love me if I was down and out?\nWould you still have love for me? Girl\n\nNow would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?\nDo you believe me when I tell you: you the one I'm lovin'?\nAre you mad 'cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?\nAre you my soul mate?

        "Lyrics": "(Fabolous)\nBaby girl\nYou know my situation\nAnd sometimes I know you get impatient\nBut you don't put to on a show to get ovations\nTake it to court and go through litagations\nAnd I respect ya gangsta\nTreat you like a princess\nAnd put something on your neck to thank ya\nShe's my pinch hitta\nWhen the startin lineup ain't playin' right\nI come off the bench wit her\nIt might sound like I'm gassin ya\nBut it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger\nWe been creepin' and sneakin\nJust to keep it from leakin\nWe so deep in our freakin\nThat we don't sleep on the weekend\nWifey\nA little bit uptight\nWonder why he comin' home in the middle of the night\nIt'll be all right if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight\nBut I said it'll be all right c'mon\n\n(Chorus - lil mo)\nI really wanna be with you (be with you)\nBut I gotta be real with you (real with you)\nI can't leave you alone (lone)\nAnd I know I'm living wrong\nBut I can't let ya go\nYour the one I want in my life (want in my life)\nAlready got a wife (got a wife)\nCan't leave you alone (lone)\nAnd I know I'm living wrong\nBut I can't let ya go\n\n(Fabolous)\nYou ain't ever step out of line\nOr get out a pocket\nSo I made sure canary sent out your locket\nTo protect you: I'll get out and cock it\nAnd you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket\nOh: you gonna play dumb if cops do come through\nI gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through\nBut I know the boutiques and the shops you run through\nSo I cop her one: and cop you one too\nYou always get a daily page: weekly ring\nPlus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things\nI ain't gotta put a band on your finger\nI worry about you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while on springer\nAt first you were somethin' I denied\nSomething I would slide\nJust do somethin' in the ride\nBut shorty\nThere's something that you provide\nCause the entre ain't as good without somethin' on the side\n\n(Chrous)\n\n(Fabolous)\nUh oh: I might be leavin' the earth soon\nMy girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume\nIt's gonna be a clip toss if I go back\nWith stains of your lip gloss on my throwback\nShe wont care if I'm a platinum rapper\nIf she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper\nSo keep it on the down low call the carsely\nYou seen what happened with mr. big and r kelly\n\n(Lil mo)\nYou know I care for you\nAnytime this chick is there for you\nFeelings I'm'ma share wit you\nWhich makes it a lil mo clear for you",

        "Lyrics": "What's wrong with the world: mama?\nPeople livin' like they ain't got no mamas\nI think the whole world's addicted to the drama\nOnly attracted to things that'll bring you trauma\n\nOverseas: yeah: we try to stop terrorism\nBut we still got terrorists here livin'\nIn the USA: the big CIA\nThe Bloods and the Crips and the KKK\n\nBut if you only have love for your own race\nThen you only leave space to discriminate\nAnd to discriminate only generates hate\nAnd when you hate then you're bound to get irate: yeah\n\nMadness is what you demonstrate\nAnd that's exactly how anger works and operates\nMan: you gotta have love just to set it straight\nTake control of your mind and meditate\nLet your soul gravitate to the love: y'all: y'all\n\nPeople killin': people dyin'\nChildren hurt and you hear them cryin'\nCan you practice what you preach\nOr would you turn the other cheek?\n\nFather: Father: Father help us\nSend some guidance from above\n'Cause people got me: got me questionin'\nWhere is the love? (love)\n\nWhere is the love? (the love)\nWhere is the love? (the love)\n\nWhere is the love: the love: the love?\n\nIt just ain't the same: all ways are changed\nNew days are strange: is the world insane?\nIf love and peace is so strong\nWhy are there pieces of love that don't belong?\n\nNations droppin' bombs\nChemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones\nWith the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young\nSo ask yourself is the lovin' really gone?\n\nSo I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong\nIn this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in\nMakin' wrong decisions: only visions of them dividends\nNot respectin' each other: deny thy brother\nA war is goin' on but the reason's undercover\n\nThe truth is kept secret: it's swept under the rug\nIf you never know truth then you never know love\nWhere's the love: y'all: come on (I don't know)\nWhere's the truth: y'all: come on (I don't know)\nWhere's the love: y'all (come on yeah)\n\nPeople killin': people dyin'\nChildren hurt and you hear them cryin'\nCan you practice what you preach\nOr would you turn the other cheek?\n\nFather: Father: Father help us\nSend us some guidance from above\n'Cause people got me: got me questionin'\nWhere is the love? (love)\n\nWhere is the love? (the love)\nWhere is the love? (the love)\nWhere is the love?\nWhere is the love?\nWhere is the love? (the love)\nWhere is the love? (the love)\n\nWhere is the love: the love: the love?\n\nI feel the weight of the world on my shoulder\nAs I'm gettin' older: y'all: people gets colder\nMost of us only care about money makin'\nSelfishness got us followin' the wrong direction\n\nWrong information always shown by the media\nNegative images: is the main criteria\nInfecting the young minds faster than bacteria\nKids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas\n\nYo: whatever happened to the values of humanity?\nWhatever happened to the fairness and equality?\nInstead in spreading love we're spreading animosity\nLack of understanding: leading us away from unity\n\nThat's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under\nThat's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down\nThere's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under\nGotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)\n\nWhere is the love?\nWhere is the love?\nWhere is the love?\nWhere is the love?\n\nFather: Father: Father help us\nSend some guidance from above\n'Cause people got me: got me questionin'\nWhere is the love? \n\nSing with me y'all:\nOne world: one world (We only got)\nOne world: one world (That's all we got)\nOne world: one world\nAnd something's wrong with it (Yeah)\nSomething's wrong with it (Yeah)\nSomething's wrong with the wo-wo-world: yeah\nWe only got\n(One world: one world)\nThat's all we got\n(One world: one world)",

        "Lyrics": "I need a sign to let me know you're here\nAll of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere\nI need to know that things are gonna look up\n'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup\nWhen there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head\nWhen you can feel the world shake from the words that I said\n\nAnd I'm calling all angels\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\n\nAnd I won't give up if you don't give up\nI won't give up if you don't give up\nI won't give up if you don't give up\nI won't give up if you don't give up\n\nI need a sign to let me know you're here\n'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear\nI want a reason for the way things have to be\nI need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me\n\nAnd I'm calling all angels\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\n\nWhen children have to play inside so they don't disappear\nWhile private eyes solve marriage lies 'cause we don't talk for years\nAnd football teams are kissing queens and losing sight of having dreams\nIn a world where all we want is only what we want until it's ours\n\nAnd I'm calling all angels\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\nAnd I'm calling all angels\n(I won't give up if you don't give up)\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\n(I won't give up if you don't give up)\nCalling all you angels\n(I won't give up if you don't give up)\nCalling all you angels\n(I won't give up if you don't give up)\nCalling all you angels",

Hey DJ: bring that back\n\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(Hell yeah: hey DJ bring that back)\n\nHow you ain't gon' fuck? Bitch out me?\nI'm the goddamn reason you in VIP\nCEO you don't have to see ID\nI'm young: wild and strapped like Chi Ali\n\nBLAOW! We ain't got nothin' to worry about\nWhoop ass: let security carry 'em out\nWatch out for the medallion my diamonds are reckless\nFeels like a midget is hanging from my necklace\n\nI pulled up wit a million trucks\nLooking: smelling: feeling like a million bucks-ahh\nPass the bottles: the heat is on\nWe in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong\n\nWhat's wrong? The club and the moon is full\nAnd I'm lookin' for a thick: young lady to pull\nOne sure shot way to get 'em outta them pants\nTake note to the brand new dance: like dis\n\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nHell yeah! Hey DJ: bring that back\n\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(Hell yeah: hey DJ bring that back)\n\nGo on wit ya big ass: lemme see something\nTell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging\nI'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks\nBut where the fuck is the waitress at wit my drinks?\n\nMy people outside and they can't get in\nWe gon' rush the back door and break 'em in\nThe owner already pissed 'cause we sorta late\nBut our time and our clothes gotta coordinate\n\nMost girls lookin' right: some lookin' a mess\nThat's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress\nBut Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts\nGot me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest-ahh\n\nC'mon! we gon' party tonight\nY'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life\nDon't be scurred: show another part of your life\nThe more drinks in your system the harder the fight\n\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nHell yeah! Hey DJ: bring that back\n\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(When I move you move) Just like that?\n(Hell yeah: hey DJ bring that back)\n\nStand up\nStand up\nStand up\nStand up\n\nDamn right the fire marshall wanna shut us down\nGet us out so someone can gun us down\nWe was two songs away from getting some cutta\nNow we one song away from tearing da club up\n\nMove over: Luda got something to say\nDo it now 'cause tomorrow ain't promised today\nWork with me: let's become one with the beat\nAnd don't worry bout me steppin' all over ya feets\n\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nWhen I move you move (just like that?)\nHell yeah!

        "Lyrics": "Well I saw fireworks from the freeway \nAnd behind closed eyes: I cannot make them go away \n'Cause you were born on the Fourth of July\nFreedom ring\nWell something on the surface it stinks\n\nI said something on the surface \nWell it kind of makes me nervous\nTo say that you deserve this \nAnd what kind of God would serve this \nWe will cure this dirty old disease \nWell if you've gots the poison: I've gots the remedy \n\nThe remedy is the experience: this is a dangerous liaison \nI says the comedy is that it's serious\nThis is a strange enough new play on words \nI said: the tragedy is how you're going to spend\n\nThe rest of your nights with the light on\nSo shine the light on all of your friends\nWell: it all amounts to nothing \nIn the end \n\nI won't worry my life away\nI won't worry my life away\n\nWell I heard two men: talking on the radio \nIn a crossfire kind of new reality show\nUncovering the ways to plan the next big attack \nOr they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the\n\nBe right back after this \nThe unavoidable kiss: with a minty fresh death-breath \nIs sure to outlast this catastrophe \nDance with me \n'Cause if you've gots the poison: I've gots the remedy \n\nThe remedy is the experience: this is a dangerous liaison \nI says the comedy is that it's serious\nThis is a strange enough new play on words \nI said: the tragedy is how you're going to spend\n\nThe rest of your nights with the light on\nSo shine the light on all of your friends\nWhen: it all amounts to nothing \nIn the end \n\nI won't worry my life away \nI won't worry my life away \n\nWhen I fall in love\nI take my time: there's no need to hurry \nWhen I'm making up my mind\nYou can turn off the sun: but I'm still going to shine \nAnd I'll tell you why\n\nBecause the remedy is the experience: this is a dangerous liaison \nI says the comedy is that it's serious\nThis is a strange enough new play on words \nI said: the tragedy is how you're going to spend\n\nThe rest of your nights with the light on\nSo shine the light on all of your friends\nWhen: it all amounts to nothing \nIn the end\n\nI won't worry my life away\nI won't worry my life away \n\n'Cause I won't: I won't: I won't \nWon't worry my life away",

La-dy\n\n(Jay Z)\nI got my Gocha 9-7 on right now\nYou gotta puff a J to this one\nCan't roll a blunt up to this one boy\n\n(Pharrell)\nYou're so contagious: I can't take it\nHave my baby: let's just make it\nEx-cuse me; what's your name?

Please don't like him\nHe don't wife 'em: he one nights 'em!'\nNow she don't like him: she never met him\nGroupies try to take advantage of him: he won't let 'em\nHe don't need 'em: so he treats 'em like he treats 'em\nBetter them than me: she don't agree with him\nShe's mad at that: he's not havin' that\nSo those opposites attract like mag-a-nets\nShe sees more than the Benz wagon: the friends taggin along\nWith a flashy nigga braggin on the song\nShe gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that\nHe 2 ways her: so she writes back\nSmiley faces after all of her phrases\nEither she the one or I'm caught in the matrix\nFuck it: let the Fish-burn\nRed or green pill: you live and you learn. C'mon!\n\n(Pharrell)\nSex-cuse me... damn!\n\n(Jay Z)\nYou gotta throw on your fine linens for this one\n\n(Pahrrell)\nYou're so contagious: I can't take it\nHave my baby: let's just make it.

I know my past ain't one\nYou can easily get past: but that chapter is done\nBut I'm done readin for now\nRemember spades face up: you can believe him for now\nBut ma you got a f'real f'serious role\nI'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes\n'Bout to show you where the cheese: let you know I ain't playin'\nBut: before I jump out the window: what's your name?\n\n(Pharrell)\nSex-cuse me... damn!\nYou're so contagious: I can't take it\nHave my baby: let's just make it.

Lo to this headline clips\nI stayed grounded as the amounts roll in\nI'm real: I thought I told ya\n(I'm real) I really been on Oprah\n(I'm real) That's just me\nNothin' phony: don't hate on me\nWhat you get is what you see: oh\n\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\n\nI'm down to earth like this: rockin' this business\nI've grown up so much\nI'm in control and lovin' it\nRumors got me laughin': kid\nI love my life and my public\nPut God first\nAnd can't forget to stay real\nTo me: it's like breathin': yea\n\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\n\nIt take hard work to cash checks\nSo don't be fooled by the rocks that I got: they assets\nYou get back what you put out\nEven if you take the good route: can't count the hood out\nAfter a while: you know who to blink with\nJust keep it real with the ones came in with\nBest thing to do is stay low: LOX and J. Lo\n(Everyone's got to make a livin')\nAct like they don't: but they know: yeah\n\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\n\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)\nDon't be fooled by the rocks that I got\nI'm still: I'm still Jenny from the block\nUsed to have a little: now I have a lot\nNo matter where I go: I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)",

        "Lyrics": "So: what am I not supposed to have an opinion?\nShould I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?\nCall me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind\nGuess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled\n\nWhen a female fires back\nSuddenly the target don't know how to act\nSo he does what any little boy would do\nMakin' up a few false rumors or two\n\nThat for sure is not a man to me\nSlanderin' names for popularity\nIt's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's sad)\nBut now it's time for me to come and give you more to say\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world\nWho've come across a man that don't respect your worth\nThinking all women should be seen: not heard\nSo what do we do girls? (Shout louder!)\n\nLetting 'em know we're gonna stand our ground\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can: never will: can't hold us down\n\nNobody can hold us down\nNobody can hold us down\nNobody can hold us down\nNever can: never will\n\nSo what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying\nAre you offended with the message I'm bringing\nCall me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing\nGuess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing\n\nIf you look back in history\nIt's a common double standard of society\nThe guy gets all: the glory the more he can score\nWhile the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore\n\nI don't understand why it's okay\nThe guy can get away with it and the girl gets named\nAll my ladies come together and make a change\nStart a new beginning for us everybody sing\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world\nWho've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)\nThinking all women should be seen: not heard\nWhat do we do girls? (Shout louder!)\n\nLetting them know we're gonna stand our ground\nSo lift your hands high and wave 'em proud\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can: never will: can't hold us down\n\nCheck it\n\nNow here's something I just can't understand\nIf the guy have three girls then he's the man\nHe can even give her some head: or sex her off\nBut if a girl do the same: she's a whore\n\nBut the table's about to turn: I'll bet my fame on it\nCats take my ideas and put their name on it\nIt's all right though: you can't hold me down\nI got to keep on movin'\n\nTo my girls to their man who be trying to Mac\nDo it right back to him and let that be that\nYou need to let him know that his game is whack\nAnd Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back\n\nBut you're just a little boy\nThink you're so cute: so coy\nYou must talk so big\nTo make up for smaller things\n\nSo you're just a little boy\nAll you do is annoy\nYou must talk so big\nTo make up for smaller things (This is for my girls!)\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world\nWho've come across a man who don't respect your worth\nThinking all women should be seen: not heard\nSo what do we do girls? (Shout louder!): shout louder\n\nLetting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho: ooh)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can: never will: can't hold us down\n\nThis is for my girls all around the world (For my girls)\nWho've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Around the world!)\nThinking all women should be seen: not heard (Yeaheah)\nSo what do we do girls? (Shout louder!)\n\nLetting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand my ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can: never will: can't hold us down\n\nSpread the word\nCan't hold us down\n\nYeah\nWe here\nBe back again\nYeah: Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera\n\nYeah\nCan't hold us down!",

Oh oh oh oh\nSo I asked God\n\n\nGod send me an Angel\nFrom the Heavens above\nSend me an Angel to heal my broken heart:\nFrom being in love:\n'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)\nGod send me an Angel\nTo wipe the tears from my eyes\n\nAnd I know it might sound crazy:\nBut after all that I still loved you.\nYou wanna come back in my life:\nBut now there's something I have to do.\nI have to tell the one that I once adored:\nThat they can't have my love no more:\nMy heart can't take no more lies:\nAnd my eyes are all out of cries\nSo... God\n\nNow you had me on my knees\nBegging God please\nTo send you back to me\nI couldn't eat\nI couldn't sleep\nYou even made me feel like I could not breathe\nWhen I... all I wanted to do\nWas feel your touch\nAnd to give you all of my love\nBut you took my love for granted\nWant my lovin' now\nBut you can't have it\nOh God!\n\nOh God!\n\nSend me an Angel (send me an angel)\nAn Angel!\nWipe the tears from my eyes\nGod send me an Angel from the Heavens above\nSent me an Angel (to heal my broken heart)\nGod send me an Angel\nFrom being in love\nSend me (an Angel)\nOh God!\nSend me an Angel\nSend me (an Angel)\n(An Angel)",

Let me show you what I'm all about\nHow I make a Sprite can disappear in my mouth... HO!\nShake up the dice: throw down your ice (What)\nBet it all playa fuck the price\nMoney ain't a thing throw it out like rice\nBeen around the world cop the same thing twice\nRub on my tits (Huh!) squeeze on my ass (Ooh!)\nGimme some UH! step on the gas (Ah)\nPop the cork and roll up the hatch (Roll it!)\nYou know what we about: sex: drugs and cash\n\n(Verse 3: Lil' Kim) (Mr. Cheeks)\nEnter the world of the playboy pin up girl\nButt naked dressed in nothin' but pearls\nYou wanna meet me cause ya: know I'm freaky\nAnd ya: wanna eat me cause ya: say I'm sexy\nGot a man in Japan and a dude in Tahiti\nBelieve me sweety I got enough to feed the needy\nNo need to be greedy I got mad friends that's pretty (Hey!)\nChicks by the layers (And) all different flavors (Woo!)\nMafioso that's how this thing go (Yeah)\nNow everybody come get with the lingo\nShake your body body: move your body body (Body body)\nOn the dancefloor don't hurt nobody body (Body body)\nI'm the one that put the Range in the Rover\nWhen I'm steppin out the ring yo it's over\nComin' through in the Brooklyn Mint gear\nWe 'gone do this just like Big Pop was here\n\n(Outro: Mr. Cheeks)\nYeah: to the what: yeah: oh: yo: keep it real: yeah: and worldwide\nAnd stay fly: yeah man: right right right right: Queen Bee: LB\nTwo thousand and: three: why not? we makin' it hot come through: hold ya spot\n\nShe back at it: why wouldn't she be? come on: yeah\nB.I.G.

        "Lyrics": "Tupac:\nShit: tired of getting shot at\nTired of getting chased by the police and arrested\nNiggas need a spot where we can kick it\nA spot where we belong: that's just for us\nNiggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood\nYou na'mean?\nWhere do niggas go when we die?\nAin't no heaven for a thug nigga: that's why we go to Thug Mansion\nThat's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G\nAt Thug Mansion\n\nTupac:\nA place to spend my quiet nights: time to unwind\nSo much pressure in this life of mine: I cry at times\nI once contemplated suicide and would have tried\nBut when I held that 9: all I could see was my moma's eyes\nNo one knows my struggle: they only see the trouble\nNot knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you\nPicture me inside the misery of poverty\nNo man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived\nPraying hard for 'Better Dayz': promise to hold on\nMe and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on\nWe finally found a spot to kick it\nWhere we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit\nA spot where we can smoke in peace: and even though we G's\nWe still visualize places: that we can roll in peace\nAnd in my mind's eye I see this place: the players go in fast\nI got a spot for us all: so we can ball: at 'Thugz Mansion'\n\n(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nChildren: dead homies and family\nSky high: iced out paradise\nIn the sky...\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nOnly place that's right for me\nChromed out mansion in paradise\nIn the sky...\n\n2Pac:\nWill I survive all the fights and the darkness?\nTrouble sparks: they tell me home is where the heart is: dear departed\nI shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good\nFor multiple years: witness peers catch gunshots\nNobody cares: seen the politicians ban us\nThey'd rather see us locked in chains: please explain\nWhy they can't stand us: is there a way for me to change?\nOr am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?\nI need a place to rest my head\nWith the little bit of homeboys that remains: cause all the rest dead\nIs there a spot for us to roll: if you find it\nI'll be right behind ya: show me and I'll go\nHow can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom\nWatch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him\nI need a house that's full of love when I need to escape\nThe deadly places slingin drugs: in thug's mansion\n\n\n2Pac:\nDear Mama don't cry: your baby boy's doing good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night: it had me shook\nDrinking peppermint Schnapps: with Jackie Wilson: and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday\nSang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm: till the day came\nLittle LaTasha sure grown\nTell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven: so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand only God can save us\nWhen Miles Davis cutting loose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on: they in heaven: found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist: together\nThere has to be a place better than this: in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep: dear God: what I'm asking\nRemember this face: save me a place: in 'Thugz Mansion'",

'cause I was\n\nThinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right\nThere in the middle by me\nI was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get\nGoin' where a night might lead\nI know what I was feelin'\nBut what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'",

        "Lyrics": "These ideas are nightmares to white parents\nWhose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings\nLike whatever they say has no bearing\nIt's so scary in a house that allows no swearing\n\nTo see him walking around with his headphones blaring\nAlone in his own zone: cold and he don't care\nHe's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out\nWhen he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out\n\n'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out\nBut if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out\nHis thoughts are whacked: he's mad so he's talkin' back\nTalkin' black: brainwashed from rock and rap\n\nHe sags his pants: do-rags and a stocking cap\nHis stepfather hit him so he socked him back\nAnd broke his nose: his house is a broken home\nThere's no control: he just lets his emotions go\n\n(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)\n(Come on!) Sing with me: (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)\nFor the laughter: sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me: if it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\nEntertainment is changin': intertwinin' with gangstas\nIn the land of the killers: a sinner's mind is a sanctum\nHoly or unholy: only have one homie\nOnly this gun: lonely 'cause don't anyone know me\n\nYet everybody just feels like they can relate\nI guess words are a motherfucker: they can be great\nOr they can degrade: or even worse they can teach hate\nIt's like these kids hang on every single statement we make\n\nLike they worship us: plus all the stores ship us platinum\nNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen\nFrom standin' on corners and porches just rappin'\nTo havin' a fortune: no more kissin' ass\n\nBut then these critics crucify you: journalists try to burn you\nFans turn on you: attorneys all want a turn at you\nTo get they hands on every dime you have\nThey want you to lose your mind every time you mad\n\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me\nStrictly just to get me off of these streets quickly\n\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously\nSo I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me\nThey're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me\nIf I'm such a fuckin' menace: this shit doesn't make sense B\n\nIt's all political: if my music is literal\nAnd I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl\nI couldn't: I wouldn't be fit to\nYou're full of shit too: Guerrera: that was a fist that hit you\n\n(Come on!) Sing with me: (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)\nFor the laughter: sing for the tears (Sing with me!)\nSing it with me: if it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\nThey say music can alter moods and talk to you\nWell can it load a gun up for you and cock it too\nWell if it can: then the next time you assault a dude\nJust tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued\n\nSee what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols\nAnd they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool\nNot knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves: we entertainers\nOf course the shit's affectin' our sales: you ignoramus\n\nBut music is reflection of self: we just explain it\nAnd then we get our checks in the mail: it's fucked up ain't it\nHow we can come from practically nothing\nTo being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted\n\nThat's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing\nExcept for a dream: and a fuckin' rap magazine\nWho post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long\nIdolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs\n\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives\nTill they sit and they cry at night: wishin' they'd die\nTill they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe\nWe're nothin' to you: but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes\n\nThat's why we: seize the moment try to freeze it and own it\nSqueeze it and hold it: 'cause we consider these minutes golden\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on\nThrough our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can\n\nSing with me: (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)\nFor the laughter: sing for the tears (Come on!)\nSing it with me: if it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\nSing with me: (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)\nFor the laughter: sing for the tears (Come on!)\nSing it with me: if it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away",

Yeah I know I'm wrong\nFor goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'\nHopin' ya \"Home Alone\" like Caulkin\nBut I picked the wrong time: and respect will be expected\n\n(Chorus w/ad libs)\n\nI'm so sick of bein' lon-\nAh: don't finish yo statement\nYou alone call me: I'll be yo replacement\nPut me in the game coach: you can let that lame go\nLet me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles\n'Cause ain't no mo' better: freakier feller\nFrom the Field to creep wit': when ya guys are dummy\nHoney you lookin' good: and mo' gooder than a plate of neck bones\nTenderized and yummy: the Energizer bunny can't compete with me\n'Cause I be goin' and goin': rowin'\nWith mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'\nHit it huffin' and puffin': breath stankin' and yawnin'\nSomething so pretty as you at home alone\nThat's unbelieveable: like when the cow jumped over the moon\nNow: I never put nothin' before you\nThat's like eatin' cereal: pickin' a fork over a spoon\n\nspoken:\nThis is a jazze phizzle produtizzle my nizzle.\nJazze Pha.

world\nI wanna grow together\nLet's let our love unfurl\n\nYou know you want me baby\nYou know I want you: too\nThey call me Superman\nI'm here to rescue you\n\nI wanna save you girl\nCome be in Shady's world\n(Oh boy: you drive me crazy)\nBitch: you make me hurl\n\nThey call me Superman\nLeap tall hoes in a single bound\nI'm single now: got no ring on this finger now\nI'll never let another chick bring me down\n\nIn a relationship: save it bitch\nBabysit: you make me sick\nSuperman ain't savin' shit\nGirl you can jump on Shady's dick\n\nStraight from the hip: cut to the chase\nI'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face\nPlay no games: say no names\nEver since I broke up with what's her face\n\nI'm a different man: kiss my ass\nKiss my lips: bitch why ask\nKiss my dick: get my cash\nI'd rather have you whip my ass\n\nDon't put out: I'll put you out\nWon't get out: I'll push you out\nPuss blew out: copin' shit\nWouldn't piss on fire to put you out\n\nAm I too nice to buy you ice?\nBitch if you died: wouldn't buy you life\nWhat you tryin' to be my new wife?\nWhat you Mariah: fly through twice?\n\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches they come: they go\nSaturday through Sunday: Monday\nMonday through Sunday: yo\n\nMaybe I'll love you one day\nMaybe we'll someday grow\nTill then just sit your drunk ass\nOn that fuckin' runway hoe\n\n'Cause I can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\n\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman: your Superman\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love these hoes\nIt's no secret: everybody knows\nYeah we fucked: bitch so what\nThat's about as far as your buddy goes\n\nWe'll be friends: I'll call you again\nI'll chase you around every bar you attend\nNever know what kind of car I'll be in\nWe'll see how much you'll be partying then\n\nYou don't want that: neither do I\nI don't wanna flip when I see you with guys\nToo much pride: between you and I\nNot a jealous man: but females lie\n\nBut I guess that's just what sluts do\nHow could it ever be just us two\nI never loved you enough to trust you\nWe just met and I just fucked you\n\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches they come they go\nSaturday through Sunday: Monday\nMonday through Sunday: yo\n\nMaybe I'll love you one day\nMaybe we'll someday grow\nTill then

plain old Marshall to me)\n\nOoh yeah girl run that game\n(Haily Jade: I love that name\nLove that tattoo: what's that say?\n\"Rot in Pieces\": uhh that's great)\n\nFirst off you don't know Marshall\nAt all so don't grow partial\nThat's ammo for my arsenal\nI'll slap you off that bar stool\n\nThere goes another lawsuit\nLeave hand prints all across you\nGood Lordy-wody you must be\nGone off that quarter bottle\n\nYou want what you can't have\nOoh girl that's too damn bad\nDon't touch what you can't grab\nEnd up with two back hands\n\nPut Anthrax on a Tampax\nAnd slap you till you can't stand\nGirl you just blew your chance\nDon't mean to ruin your plans\n\nBut I do know one thing though\nBitches they come they go\nSaturday through Sunday: Monday\nMonday through Sunday:
