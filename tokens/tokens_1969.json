My soul is stay.\nOh but what am I to do: my mind is in a whirlpool.\nGive me a little hope: one small thing to cling to.\n\nYou got me going in circles (oh round and round I go)\nYou got me going in circles\n(Oh round and round I go) I'm spun out over you\n(I need you baby) over you (I need you baby) spun out over you.\n\n(I need you baby: I need you baby baby)\nI'm spun (I need you baby) I said I'm spun out over you (I need you baby)\nSpun out over you (I need you baby: I need you baby: I need you baby)",

        "Lyrics": "Well: my daddy left home when I was three\nAnd he didn't leave much to Ma and me\nJust this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze\n\nNow: I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid\nBut the meanest thing that he ever did\nWas before he left: he went and named me Sue\n\nWell: he musta thought that it was quite a joke\nAnd it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks\nSeems I had to fight my whole life through\n\nSome gal would giggle and I'd get red\nAnd some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head\nI'll tell ya: life ain't easy for a boy named Sue\n\nWell: I grew up quick and I grew up mean\nMy fist got hard and my wits got keen\nI roamed from town to town to hide my shame\n\nBut I made me a vow to the Moon and stars\nI'd search the honky-tonks and bars\nAnd kill that man that give me that awful name\n\nWell: it was Gatlinburg in mid-July\nAnd I'd just hit town and my throat was dry\nI thought I'd stop and have myself a brew\n\nAt an old saloon on a street of mud\nThere at a table dealin' stud\nSat the dirty: mangey dog that named me Sue\n\nWell I knew that snake was my own sweet dad\nFrom a worn out picture that my mother had\nAnd I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye\n\nHe was big and bent and grey and old\nAnd I looked at him and my blood ran cold: and I said\n\"My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!\"\nYeah!  That's what I told him\n\nWell: I hit him hard right between the eyes\nAnd he went down but to my surprise\nCame up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear\n\nI busted a chair right across his teeth\nAnd we crashed through the wall and into the street\nKickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer\n\nI tell ya: I've fought tougher men\nBut I really can't remember when\nHe kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile\n\nWell: I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss\nHe went for his gun but I pulled mine first\nHe stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile\n\nAnd he said: \"Son: this world is rough\nAnd if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough\nAnd I know I wouldn't be there to help you along\n\nSo I gave you that name and I said goodbye\nI knew you'd have to get tough or die\nAnd it's that name that helped to make you strong\"\n\nYeah!  He said: \"Now you just fought one hell of a fight\nAnd I know you hate me and ya got the right\nTo kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do\n\nBut you oughta thank me before I die\nFor the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye\n'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue\"\nYeah: what could I do?  What could I do?\n\nI got all choked up and threw down my gun\nCalled him my Pa and he called me his son\nAnd I come away with a different point of view\n\nAnd I think about him now and then\nEvery time I try and every time I win\nAnd if I ever have a son: I think I'm gonna name him\nBill or George: any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!",

Na: na: na: na...\nYou got to come down from that cloud girl and Leave your world behind.",
