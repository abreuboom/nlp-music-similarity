Real high 'cause I'm just so fly\nA young lovable: hugable type of guy\nAnd everything is to the back with a little slack\n'Cause inside-out is wiggity: wiggity: wiggity wack\n\nI come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'\nR&B: rappin' bull crap is what I'm dumpin'\nAin't nothin' sucker about Kris Kross: we all that\nSo when they ask: \"Do they rock?\" Say: \"Believe that.\"\n\nJump: jump\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nUh huh: uh huh\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nI like my stuff knockin' (Knockin')\nI love it when a girl is like jockin' (Jockin')\nThe D-A double-D-Y M-A-C yeah you know me\nI got you jumpin' and bumpin' and pumpin': movin' all around G\n\nIn the mix: I make you take a step back\nThey try to step to the Mac: then they got jacked\nTo the back you'll be frontin' again: is that coincidental?\nAnd like you know it: don't be claiming that it's mental\n\nTwo lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard\nAnd none faking you can understand every word\nAs you listen to my cool: smooth melody\nThe Daddy makes you J-U-M-P\n\nJump: jump\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nUn huh: uh huh\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nNow: the formalities of this and that\nIs that Kris Kross ain't comin' off wack\nAnd for all y'all suckas that don't know\nCheck it out\n\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't\n\n'Cause I'm the miggity: miggity: miggity: miggity Mac Daddy\nThe miggity: miggity: miggity: miggity Mac\n'Cause I'm the miggity: miggity: miggity: miggity Mac Daddy\nMiggity: miggity: miggity: miggity Mac\n\nI make you wanna jump: jump\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nUh huh: uh huh: jump: jump\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nUh huh: uh huh: jump: jump\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\n\nUh huh: uh huh: jump: jump\nThe Mac Dad will make you jump: jump\nDaddy Mac will make you jump: jump\nKris Kross will make you jump: jump\nBelieve that",

I wanna listen to it: okay?\nThat thing's too loud! You've got things to do tomorrow: so turn it off! Now!\n(KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK)\nYeah: right: too late? Sure... eat this.\n\nMICHAEL\nOw!\nOw!\n\nI took my baby on a Saturday bang\nBoy: is that girl with you?\nYes: we're one and the same\nNow I believe in miracles\nAnd a miracle has happened tonight!\nHee!\nBut if you're thinkin' about my baby\nIt don't matter if you're black or white\n\nOoh!\n\nThey print my message in the Saturday sun\nI had to tell them I ain't second to none\nAnd I told about equality\nAnd it's true: either you're wrong or you're right!\nOoh!\nBut if you're thinkin' about my baby\nIt don't matter if you're black or white\nHee!\nDon't compare!\nHee hee!\n\nI am tired of this devil\nI am tired of this stuff\nI am tired of this business\nSewn when the going gets rough\n\nI ain't scared of your brother\nI ain't scared of no sheets\nI ain't scared of nobody\nSewn: when the goin' gets mean\n\nRAP SINGER\nProtection\nFor gangs: clubs and nations\nCausing grief in human relations\nIt's a turf war\nOn a global scale\nI'd rather hear both sides of the tale\nSee: it's not about races:\nJust places\nFaces\nWhere your blood comes from\nIs where your space is\nI've seen the bright get duller\nI'm not going to spend my life being a color\n\nMICHAEL\nDon't tell me you agree with me\nWhen I saw you kicking dirt in my eye\nHee hee!\nBut if you're thinkin' about my baby\nIt don't matter if you're black or white\n\nI said if you're thinkin' of being my baby\nIt don't matter if you're black or white\n\nI said if you're thinkin' of being my brother\nIt don't matter if you're black or white\n\nAlright: alright: oh\nOoh: ooh\nAlright\nYeah yeah yeah: now\nAlright: alright\nOoh ooh\nSh'mon: now\nYeah yeah yeah: now\nAlright\nOoh ooh\n\nIt's black: it's white\nIt's tough for you to get by\nIt's black: it's white\nWhoo!\nIt's black: it's white\nIt's tough for you to get by\nIt's black: it's white\nWhoo!",

        "Lyrics": "When I look into your eyes\nI can see a love restrained\nBut darling: when I hold you\nDon't you know I feel the same: yeah\n\nNothing lasts forever\nAnd we both know hearts can change\nAnd it's hard to hold a candle\nIn the cold November rain\n\nWe've been through this such a long: long time\nJust trying to kill the pain: ooh yeah\nBut lovers always come and lovers always go\nAnd no one's really sure who's letting go today: walking away\nIf we could take the time to lay it on the line\nI could rest my head just knowing that you were mine: all mine\n\nSo if you want to love me\nThen darling: don't refrain\nOr I'll just end up walking\nIn the cold November rain\n\nDo you need some time on your own?\nDo you need some time all alone?\nOoh: everybody needs some time on their own\nOoh: don't you know you need some time all alone?\n\nI know it's hard to keep an open heart\nWhen even friends seem out to harm you\nBut if you could heal a broken heart\nWouldn't time be out to charm you?\n\nSometimes I need some time on my own\nSometimes I need some time all alone\nOoh: everybody needs some time on their own\nOoh: don't you know you need some time all alone?\n\nAnd when your fears subside\nAnd shadows still remain: ooh yeah\nI know that you can love me\nWhen there's no one left to blame\n\nSo nevermind the darkness\nWe still can find a way\nNothing lasts forever\nEven cold November rain\n\nDon't you think that you need somebody?\nDon't you think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody\nYou're not the only one\nYou're not the only one\n\nDon't you think that you need somebody?\nDon't you think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody\nYou're not the only one\nYou're not the only one\n\nDon't you think that you need somebody?\nDon't you think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody\nYou're not the only one\nYou're not the only one\n\nDon't you think that you need somebody?\nDon't you think that you need someone?\nEverybody needs somebody",

        "Lyrics": "When you trust someone\nAnd you know you're on their back\nYou ain't got no trustin' about you\n\nAnd you claim that you\nDon't care where I'm at\nYou've given me reason to doubt you\n\nSay you trust someone\nWhy ya callin' all around\nThink I've got some dip on the side\n\nGirl you don't trust no one\nAnd you constantly in doubt\nYou lose the game\nIf you play that way\n\nGet up off me back\nSave your heart attack\nAin't nobody is humpin' around\n\nNo matter what they say\nNo it ain't that way\nAin't nobody humpin' around\n\nWhen you love someone\nAnd you want to love 'em right\nGot to get more lovin' about cha\n\nWhen you know\nThat you're holdin' on too tight\nSoon they will be leavin' without you\n\nSay that you love someone\nWhy you callin' all my friends\nThinkin' I got somethin' to hide\n\nGirl you don't love no one\nYou don't know what love's about\nYou lose the game\nIf you: if you play that way\n\nGet up off me back\nSave your heart attack\nAin't nobody is humpin' around\n\nNo matter what they say\nNo it ain't that way\nAin't nobody humpin' around\n\nGirl when you love someone\nYou don't call on everybody\nAin't nobody foolin' around\n\nAnd the more I think about it\nYou'll lose all your clout and\nYou lose the game baby\nIf you play that way\n\nBack to the BB Brown\nBack to the BB Brown\nBack to the BB Brown\n\nMy name is Brown: that's what I'm called so\nDon't try to step on me wrong or you'll fall slow\n'Cause I just want to kick soul to ya\nMaybe: baby: take control of ya: just like I told ya\n\nI wanna roll on the tip that's moving\nAble to make you move and groove\nAnd leave you like ooh when I touch ya\nGive you so much of the feeling of the deck\nThat I'm dealing when I rub ya up and down\nYo Stylz kick it\n\nWell: I know it's been a while\nSince you heard a change in our style\nSo what I've come to do is kick you something fly and new\nA change: different from the typical a bit more than regular\nNot like the others original: 'cause originality\nAnd creativity add it up together equals the B.B.B. posse\nYeah: we've in the house: yo kick it\n\nGet up off me back\nSave your heart attack\nAin't nobody is humpin' around\n\nNo matter what they say\nNo it ain't that way\nAin't nobody humpin' around\n\nGet up off me back\nSave your heart attack\nAin't nobody is humpin' around\n\nNo matter what they say\nNo it ain't that way\nAin't nobody humpin' around\n\nGet up off me back\nSave your heart attack\nAin't nobody is humpin' around\n\nNo matter what they say\nNo it ain't that way\nAin't nobody humpin' around",

Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide: no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes: look up to the skies and see\n\nI'm just a poor boy: I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come: easy go: little high: little low\nAnyway the wind blows: doesn't really matter to me: to me\n\nMama: just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head: pulled my trigger: now he's dead\nMama: life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\n\nMama: ooh: didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on: carry on: as if nothing really matters\n\nToo late: my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine: body's aching all the time\nGoodbye: everybody: I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\n\nMama: ooh: (Any way the wind blows) I don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche: Scaramouche: will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolts and lightning: very: very frightening me\n\nGalileo (Galileo): Galileo (Galileo)\nGalileo: Figaro: Magnifico: oh: oh: oh: oh: oh\n\nI'm just a poor boy: nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\n\nEasy come: easy go: will you let me go?\nBismillah: no: we will not let you go (Let him go)\nBismillah: we will not let you go (Let him go)\nBismillah: we will not let you go (Let me go)\nNever let you go (Let me go)\nNever let you go (Never: never: never let me go: oh: oh: oh)\nNo: no: no: no: no: no: no\n\nOh: mamma mia: mamma mia\nMamma mia: let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside\nFor me: for me: for me\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh baby: can't do this to me: baby\nJust gotta get out: just gotta get right out of here\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-yeah: ooh-yeah\n\nNothing really matters: anyone can see\nNothing really matters: nothing really matters to me\n\nAny way the wind blows",

She went down to Holly Springs.\nRasha Don and Baba?  They went down to Peachtree.\nHeadliner: I challenge you to a game of horseshoes.\nA game of horseshoes!\n\nNow I see the importance of history\nWhy my people be in the mess that they be\nMany journeys to freedom made in vain\nMy brothers on the corner playing ghetto games\n\nI ask you Lord why you enlightened me\nWithout the enlightenment of all my folks\nHe said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth\nAnd you was there to quench my thirst\nBut I am still thirsty...\n\nThe Lord allowed me to drink some more\nHe said what I am searching for\nAre the answers to all which are in front of me\nThe ultimate truth started to get blurry\nFor some strange reason it had to be\nIt was all a dream about Tennessee\n\nTake me to another place (Home)\nTake me to another land (Home)\nMake me forget all that hurts me\nLet me understand your plan\n\nTake me to another place (Home)\nTake me to another land (Home)\nMake me forget all that hurts me\nLet me understand your plan\n\nOh won't you let me\nWon't you help me\nWon't you help me understand you plan?\nTake me home\nTake me home\nHome\nTake me to another place\nTake me home\nOh you know I need to go home: yeah\n\nHeadliner? I won the game of horseshoes.\nNow you owe me a watermelon.\nLet's go climb trees and skip over rocks:\nDo like they do below the border.\nHmm? Speech's hair?\nNo it look like the roots of the tree my ancestors were hung from.\nBut that's okay: get it: 'cuz he's down to earth.\nTennessee.\nTennessee: Whoo! Yeah\nTennessee.\n\nTe-Tenness...",

Dawn fan\nBut I had to put her right back with the rest\nThat's the way it goes: I guess\n\nBaby you send me\nBaby you send me\nSet adrift on memory bliss of you\nBaby you send me\nBaby you send me\nSet adrift on memory bliss of you\n\nBaby you send me\nBaby you send me\nSet adrift on memory bliss of you\nBaby you send me\nBaby you send me\nSet adrift on memory bliss of you\n\nBaby you send me\nBaby you send me\nSet adrift on memory bliss of you\nBaby you send me\nBaby you send me\nSet adrift on memory bliss of you",

America the Beautiful\nHuh: yeah: let me introduce y'all... to the Wildside\n\nAnnie was a high school cheerleader\nPom poms and bobby socks: no girl was sweeter\nCome Prom time everybody was on the line\nAll the fellas swinging nickel and dime\nTales about love and lust and trust\nBut Annie took it all in stride\n'Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations\nWanted to be a chemical engineer\nMaking fifty to fifty-five thousand a year\nHer first year of college was a success\nBut along came Billy possessed and obsessed\nHe took Annie on a fatal date\nAnd showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate\nAnnie took a hit breathed two short breaths\nOne for life... the last for death\nNow she's gone: a former Valedictorian\nEnded up becoming a topic for historians\nWashed up dreams and shattered pride\nAll because Annie took a hit - on the Wildside\n\nRon had enough of being broke everyday\nSaying to himself: there's gotta be a better way\n'Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches\nSo Ron figured out a faster way to make - money\nBefore you know it: he's a rich man\nGold on every finger of his hand\nA brand new BMW: a condo: Ron ended up a John Doe\nA body was found in the alley but never claimed\nFull of bullet holes but none to blame\nRon became another victim of homicide\nBecause he chose to walk - on the Wildside\n\nCharles had everything going for him\nA top paying job: a good life: a good wife\nA baby boy on the way any day\nA gentleman attitude is all he displayed\nCarol was the wife he loved and adored\nHer family and friends treated him like an Ambassador\nOne night on the other side of town\nA police dispatcher picked up a weird sound\nCharles on the car phone asking for help\nClaiming a burglar shot his wife and himself\nHis pregnant wife lay slumped over\nDreams corrupted and a young life over\nExtensive searches throughout the projects\nPut a lot of people through misery and wreck\nEveryone a suspect till someone was found\nInterrogated 'cause their skin was brown\nThen there was Bennett: guilty until proven so\nBut soon as the case started moving slow\nWhat do you know: sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed\nCharles was the culprit\nThe whole plot was an insurance scam\nCharles and his brother came up with a plan\nKill Carol: collect a big check\nBlame it on a black man: what the heck?\nAnd just before the story was known\nCharles had a feeling that his cover was blown\nSo he jumped off a bridge\nCommitted suicide\nThis is how it is - on the Wildside\n\nLittle Tiffany: only thirteen\nCame to the city: place of big dreams\nVisiting family and friends for the summertime\nSittin' on a mailbox: watchin' the boys climb trees\nAnd the girls play hopscotch\nSo far: her vacation was top notch\nThen out of the blue: a Mercedes at top speed\nGang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede\nQuick as a blink shots rang out loud\nAnd a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd\nOne hit Tiffany: and instantly she died\nInnocently - on the Wildside",

I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\n\nOoh: when I met you I just knew that\nYou would take my heart and run\nUntil you told me how you felt for me\nYou said I'm not the one\nSo I slowly came to see\nAll of the things that you were made of\nAnd now I hope my dreams and inspirations\nLead me toward some real love\n\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\n\nI got to have a real love\n\nLoves so true and oh baby\nI thought that love was you\nI thought you were the answer to\nThe question in my mind\nBut it seems that I was wrong\nIf I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love\n\nSo I try my best and pray to God\nHe'll send me someone real\nTo caress me and to guide me towards\nThe love my heart can feel\nNow I know I can be faithful\nI can be your all in all\nI'll give you good luvin' through the summer time\nWinter: spring: and fall\n\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\n\nYou see I'm searching for a real love\nAnd I don't know where to go\nBeen around the world and high and low\nAnd still I'll never know\nHow it feels to have a real love\n'Cause it seems it's not around\nGotta end it in this way because it\nSeems he can't be found\n\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nReal love. I'm searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love.

Yeah!\nThinkin' back on all the arguments\nThinkin' back way back when\nWe kissed and made up and all was fair in love\n\nSo now we gotta go back baby (maybe we can turn the hands of time)\nGoing back to when (Going back to when you were mine)\nWhen we were one (remembering the times when we were one: one in love)\nWhen love was fun (oh baby: baby)\nDig it...\n\nRemembering the first time you showed me your love\nThe feeling was so strong heaven sent from above\nBut you had no right to play with my heart.\nYou showed no shame\nTime after time and place after place\nNight after night and day after day\nI'm still missing your love and the feelings we share\nSometimes I cry at night 'cause I feel so all alone.\nI need your love right here with me to keep me safe and warm.\n\n(Maybe we can turn the hands of time)\nI'm going back to when (going back to when: when you were mine)\nWhen we were one... we were one girl.\nOh baby girl...\nWhen we were one...\nBaby save me: I'm thinkin': thinkin' back...\nPlay Mr. Music Man Play\nPlay Mr. Music Man\nUa... oh... oh...\nI'm Thinkin' back...",

Coltrane\nI spiggedy-spark a spiff and give a twist like Chubby Checker\nI take my Froot Loops with two scoops: make it double decker\nOh Vince: the baby come to Papa Duke\nA babaloo: ooh: a babaloo boogedy boo\nI went from Gucci to Stussy: to fliggedy-flam a groupie\nTo Zsa Zsa: to yibbedy-yabba dabba hoochie koochie\nTally ho I-I'll take my Stove Top instead of potatoes: so\nMaybe I'll shoot 'em now: nope maybe I'll shoot 'em later: yep\nI used to have a dog and Bingo was his name oh: so uh\nB - I - N - G - O-oh\nYou do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around: hon: so uh\nDun dun dun dun dun: dun dun\n\nThey want EFX: some live EFX\nThey want EFX: some live EFX\nThey want EFX: some live EFX\nSnap a neck for some live EFX",
