Come on: now\n\nIf you wanna go and take a ride with me\nWe three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh: why do I love this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\nIf you wanna go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benzy\nOh: why must I feel this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\n\nIn the club on the late night: feelin' right\nLookin' tryin' to spot somethin' real nice\nLookin' for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home\nI can take home\nShe can be 18: 18 with an attitude\nOr 19 kinda snotty actin' real rude\nBoo: as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl: you know that it's on\nYou know that it's on\n\nI peepin' somethin' comin' towards me up the dance flo'\nSexy and real slow: hey\nSayin' she was peepin' and: \"I dig the last video\"\n\"So when: Nelly: can we go?\"\nHow could I tell her no?\nHer measurements was 36-25-34\nYellin' I like the way you brush your hair\nAnd I like those stylish clothes you wear\nI like the way the light hit the ice and glare\nAnd I can see you boo from way over there\n\nIf you wanna go and take a ride with me\nWe three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh: why do I love this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\nIf you wanna go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benzy\nOh: why must I feel this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\n\nFace and body: front and back: don't know how to act\nWithout no vouchers or no boozers: she's bringin' nuttin' back\nYou should feel the impact: shop on plastic\nWhen the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that\nWatch me as I gas that: 4 dot 6 Range\nWatch the candy paint change: every time I switch lanes\nIt feel strange now\nMakin' a livin' off my brain instead of 'caine now\nI got the title from my mama put the whip in my own name now\nDamn: shit done changed now\nRunnin' credit checks with no shame now\nI feel the fame now (come on): I can't complain now (no more)\nShit I'm the man now: in and out my own town\nI'm gettin' pages out of New Jersey: from Courtney B\nTellin' me about a party up in NYC\nCan I make it? Damn right: I be on the next flight\nPayin' cash: first class: sittin' next to Vanna White (come on)\n\nIf you wanna go and take a ride with me\nWe three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh: why do I love this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\nIf you wanna go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benzy\nOh: why must I feel this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\n\nIf you wanna go and take a ride with me\nWe three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh: why do I love this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\nIf you wanna go and get high with me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benzy\nOh: why must I feel this way? (Hey: must be the money!)\n\nCheck: check\nYo: I know somethin' you don't know\nAnd I got somethin' to tell ya\nYou won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow\nMost said that I was a failure\nBut now the same muthafuckers askin' me fo' dough\nAnd I'm yellin' \"I can't help ya\"\n\"But: Nelly: can we get tickets to the next show?\"\nHell no! (What's with you?!) You for real?\n\nCity Spud:\nHey yo: now that I'm a fly guy: and I fly high\nNiggas wanna know why: why I fly by\nBut yo it's all good: Range Rover: all wood\nDo me like you should: fuck me good: suck me good\nWe be no stud niggas: wishin' you was niggas\nPoppin' like we drug dealers: sippin' Crissy: bubb' mackin\nHoney in the club: me in the Benz\nIcy grip: tellin' me to leave wit you and your friends\nSo if shorty wanna... knock (knock): we knockin' to this\nAnd if shorty wanna... rock (rock): we rockin' to this\nAnd if shorty wanna... pop (pop): we poppin' the Crist'\nShorty wanna see the ice: then I ice the wrist\nCity talk: Nelly listen; Nelly talk: City listen\nWhen I fuck fly bitches; when I walk: pay attention\nSee the ice and the glist'; niggas starin' or they diss\nHunnies lookin' all they wish: come on boo: give me kiss: come on\n\nIf you wanna go and take a ride with me\nWe three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's\nOh: why do I love this way?

Aah ah ooo\n\nIt's driven me before and it seems to be the way\nThat everyone else gets around\nBut lately I'm beginning to find\nThat when I drive myself my light is found\n\nWhatever tomorrow brings: I'll be there\nWith open arms and open eyes: yeah\nWhatever tomorrow brings: I'll be there\nI'll be there\n\nWould you choose water over wine?\nHold the wheel and drive\n\nWhatever tomorrow brings\nI'll be there with open arms and open eyes: yeah\nWhatever tomorrow brings I'll be there\nI'll be there\n\nDoo-doo-doo: doo-doo-doo: doo-doo: doo: doo-doo\nMm-bum-mm-bum: doo-doo: doo: doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo: doo-doo-doo: doo-doo: doo: doo-doo\nMm-bum: bum: bum: bum",

        "Lyrics": "Boys and girls: wanna hear a true story?\nSaturday night was at this real wild party\nThey had the liquor overflowing the cup\nAbout five: six strippers trying to work for a buck\n\nAnd I took one girl outside with me\nHer name was Lila: she went to junior high with me\nI said: \"Why you up in there dancing for cash?\nI guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last\": she said\n\n(What would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor?\n'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money)\n\n(And his daddy's gone: somewhere smoking rock now\nIn and out of lock down: I ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time\nBut for me this is what I call life: mmm)\n\nGirl: you ain't the only one with a baby\nBut that's no excuse to be living all crazy\nThen she looked me right square in the eye\nAnd said: \"Everyday I wake up hoping to die\"\n\nShe said: \"Nigga: I know about pain 'cause\nMe and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us\nBefore I was a teenager\nI'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to\"\n\n(What would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor?\n'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money)\n\n(And his daddy's gone: somewhere smoking rock now\nIn and out of lock down: I ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time\nBut for me this is what I call life: mmm)\n\nNo: wait: hold on: hold on: hold on: hold on\nStop the record: yo: stop the record!\nYo: Shorty: you ain't gotta be goin' out like this: man!\n(Holdup)\n\n(What would you do?)\nGet up on my feet and let go of every excuse\n(What would you do?)\n'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through\n\n(Come on: what would you do?)\nGet up on my feet and stop makin' tired excuses\n(What would you do?)\nGirl: I know if my mother could do it: baby: you can do it\nYeah: yeah: yeah: yeah\n\n(What would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor?\n'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money)\n\n(And his daddy's gone: somewhere smoking rock now\nIn and out of lock down: I ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time\nBut for me this is what I call life: mmm)\n\nWhat would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor?\n'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money\n\nAnd his daddy's gone: somewhere smoking rock now\nIn and out of lock down: I ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time\nBut for me this is what I call life: come on\n\n(What would you do if your son was at home\nCrying all alone on the bedroom floor?\n'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to\nSleep with a man for a little bit of money)\n\n(And his daddy's gone: somewhere smoking rock now\nIn and out of lock down: I ain't got a job now\nSo for you this is just a good time\nBut for me this is what I call life: mmm)",

I've got to go\n\nAll that matters is\nThat you treat me right\nGive me all the things I need\nThat money can't buy: yeah\n\nThink you gotta keep me iced: you don't\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash: I won't\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\nThink I wanna drive your Benz: I don't\nIf I wanna floss: I got my own\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\n\nA thing: a thing: a thing\nYeah: yeah: yeah\n\nYou think the money that you make\nCan substitute the time you take\nTo get the keys into my heart\nThink you can win my heart: don't know what's in my heart\nI think you need to take some time\nTo show me that your love is true\nThere's more than dollar signs in you\nThen you can win my heart: and get what's in my heart\n\nThink you gotta keep me iced: you don't\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash: I won't\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\nThink I wanna drive your Benz: I don't\nIf I wanna floss: I got my own\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\n\nThink you gotta keep me iced: you don't\nThink I'm gonna spend your cash: I won't\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing\nThink I wanna drive your Benz: I don't\nIf I wanna floss: I got my own\nEven if you were broke\nMy love don't cost a thing",

        "Lyrics": "Come my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\n\nSuch a sexy: sexy: pretty little thing\nFierce nipple pierce: you got me sprung with your tongue ring\nAnd I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high\nSo: to keep you by my side: there's nothing that I won't try\n\nButterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill\nTime is passing: I'm asking: \"Could this be real?\"\n'Cause I can't sleep: I can't hold still\nThe only thing I really know is she got sex appeal\n\nI can feel too much is never enough\nYou're always there to lift me up when these times get rough\nI was lost: now I'm found ever since you've been around\nYou're the woman that I want: so: yo: I'm putting it down\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nI don't deserve you\nUnless it's some kind of hidden message\nTo show me life is precious then I guess it's true\nBut to tell the truth: I really never knew till I met you\n\nSee: I was lost and confused: twisted and used up\nKnew a better life existed but thought that I missed it\nMy lifestyle's wild: I was living like a wild child\nTrapped on a short leash: parole: the police files\n\nSo: yo\nWhat's happening now?\nI see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds\nAnd a vision of you standing out in a crowd: so\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nHey: sugar mama: come and dance with me\nThe smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me\nWhatever tickles your fancy\nGirl: it's me and you like Sid and Nancy\n\nSo sexy: almost evil\nTalk about butterflies in my head\nI used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read\nBut you made me feel alive when I was almost dead\n\nYou filled that empty space with the love I used to chase\nAnd as far as I can see: it don't get better than this\nSo: butterfly: here is a song\nAnd it's sealed with a kiss and a \"Thank you: miss.\"\n\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nSo: come and dance with me: uh-huh: uh-huh\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nCome my lady: come come: my lady\nYou're my butterfly sugar baby\nI'll make your legs shake\nYou make me go crazy\n\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me: uh-huh: uh-huh\n\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\n\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me\nCome and dance with me",

(Let's talk about it)\n\nI was checking this girl next door\nWhen her parents went out\nShe'd phone: say \"Hey boy: come on right around\"\nSo I knock at the door: you were standing\nWith a bottle of red wine: ready to pour\nDressed in long black satin: lace to the floor\nSo I went in: then we sat down: start kissing: caressing\nTold me 'bout jacuzzi: sounded interesting: so we jumped right in\nAll calls diverted to answerphone\n\"Please leave a message after the tone\"\n\nI mean me and her parents were kind of cool\nBut they were the fine line between me and you\nWe were just doing things young people in love do\nParents trying to find out what we were up to\nSaying \"Why were you creeping 'round late last night?\nWhy did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?\nNow you're dressed in black: when I left you were dressed in white\nCan you fill me in?\nCalls diverted to answerphone: red wine bottle half the contents gone\nMidnight return: jacuzzi turned on\nCan you fill me in?\" (It's another one: it's another one)\n\nWhenever the coast was clear: and she'd ask me to come out\nI'd say \"Hey girl: come on right around\"\nSo she knocked at the door: I was standing\nWith the keys in my hand to the 4x4: jumped in my ride\nChecking that nobody saw\nThe club we went in: we got down: bounce bounce to the rhythm\nSaw it was early morning: thought we'd better be leaving\nSo I gave you my jacket for you to hold\nTold you to wear it 'cause you felt cold\n\nI mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules\nI weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools\nWe were just doing things young people in love do\nParents trying to find out what we were up to\nSaying \"Why can't you keep your promises no more?\nSaying you'll be home by 12: come strolling in at 4\nOut with the girls but leaving with the boy next door\nCan you fill me in?\nWearing a jacket: whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi\nBut you left all your money on the TV (You told me)\nCan you fill me in?\" (Can you fill me in?)\n\nAll they seem to do is be checking up on you: baby (Craig David)\nWatching your every move\nThink some day they might approve? Baby\n\nWhy were you creeping 'round late last night?\nWhy did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?\nNow you're dressed in black: when I left you were dressed in white\nCan you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)\nCalls diverted to answerphone: red wine bottle half the contents gone (Ooh yeah)\nMidnight return: jacuzzi turned on\nCan you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)",

Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener\nBad! Like that student in the principal's office\nPut rappers in coffins\nThey dive like dolphins\nI'm the ???? lyrical marvel ??????? officer\nWatch yourself!\nOr fuck around and get beside yourself\nI know! Go ahead though\nBounce them titties: shake ya ass: drop that pussy\nStay in line hoe\nFuck a think: 'cause you can can\nCocked up: head down: pussy poppin' on a handstand\nLeave that pussy smoking\nIf you gonna lose something\nThen bend over: and bust that pussy open\n\n(Mystikal)\nMy fuckin' concert line around the corner\nParking cars: niggas lookin' for they bitch: nothing on her!\nYou lookin' good momma\nWhy? Pshh: what's up homie?\nSirens: limousines: and the club owner\nYa bitch you!\nIf you late: ain't no getting in this bitch\n'Cause it's filling up\nInside packed from the floor to the ceiling up\nThe building ain't big enough!\nI'm backstage bouncing\nAdrenalin building up!\nThe pussy cutter\nDid I stutter?\nThe heart flooder\nMake your woman drawers melt like butter\nDown like Nelly\nHype like \"Belly\"\nThe rhyme seller!\nKick ass like Jim Kelly!\nStand up: round out: boot up and frown\nTell a nigga if he wanna try it\nThen bitch come on down!\nNo sweat: no blood: no tears\nAnd if I tell you it's the shit\nThen BITCH THAT'S WHAT IT IS!\n\nDanger!\nTalkin' 'bout\nDanger!\nMotherfucker look!\nGet on the floor!\nThe nigga right chea!\nDanger!\n(Motherfucker) Watch your back!\nDanger!\n(Look look) Nigga what!

        "Lyrics": "I pulled into the shopping center\nAnd saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother.\nLike ice cream melting: they embraced:\nYears of bad decisions running down her face.\nAll mornin' I'd been thinking my life's so hard:\nAnd they wore everything they owned: living in a car.\nI wanted to tell 'em it would be okay:\nBut I just got in my Suburban and I drove away.\n\nAnd I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.\nI don't know why they say grown men don't cry.\n\nKeep having this dream about my old man:\nI'm ten years old and he's holding my hand.\nWe're talking on the front porch\nWatching the sun go down:\nBut it was just a dream.\nHe was a slave to his job\nAnd he couldn't be around.\nSo many things I want to say to him:\nBut I just placed a rose on his grave:\nAnd I talked to the wind.\n\nAnd I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.\nI don't know why they say grown men don't cry: don't cry.\n\nI'm sitting here with my kids and my wife\nAnd everything that I hold dear in my life.\nWe say grace: and thank the Lord\nGot so much to be thankful for.\nThen its up the stairs and off to bed\nAnd my little girl says:\n\"I haven't had my story: yet.\"\nAnd everything weighing on my mind disapears just like that\nWhen she lifts her head off her pillow and says:\n\"I love you: dad!\"\n\nAnd I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.\nI don't know why they say grown men don't cry.\n\nAnd I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.\nI don't know why they say grown men don't cry: don't cry.",

I'm just gettin' in about to check my message:\nNo one has called but my homies and some bill collectors.\nSay your love when somebody wants to borrow money\nI two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny.\nSo I called her mother's house and asked has she seen my baby.\nRoll my six around lookin' for that missing lady.\nGot back in turned the TV on and caught the news\nThen I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused.\nAnd then I turned the TV down\n'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound:\nThere's something going on upstairs\nAnd I know nobody else lives here\n\"Bump bump bump\" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear\nAnd then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screamin out...\n\nYour contagious: touch me baby give me what you got\n(Then a man said)\nSexy lady drive me crazy: drive me wild\n(I just can't believe it)\n\nI ran downstairs looked in the closet lookin' for that ooh:\nSaid a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do\nWhat I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild\nI'm in the hall contemplatin \"not in my own damn house\".\nWho would have thought she was creepin' wit another man?\nDown Low (Nobody Has To Know) happenin' to me all over again\nAnd then I turned the TV down: TV down\n'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound:\nThere's something going on upstairs\n'Cause I know ain't no one else lives here\n\"Bump bump bump\" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear:\nAnd then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screamin...\n\nYour contagious: touch me baby give me what you got\n(Then a man said)\nSexy lady drive me crazy: drive me wild\n(I just can't believe it)\n\nYour contagious: touch me baby give me what you got\nSexy lady drive me crazy: drive me wild\n\nWhat the hell is goin' on between the sheets in my home?\nBaby wait let me explain before you start to point your cain.\nGirl I'm bout to have a fit!\nOh it's about to be some shit!\nHow did I get in to this? Should have never came home with this bitch!\nLow down dirty woman: back to where you come from\nBut baby wait-- - \"But wait\" my ass\nHit the streets your ass is grass!\nNow Mista Biggs before you jump--\nWait how you know my name son?!\nHoney wait I was gonna tell ya...\nMove this cat looks real familiar\nHmmm?!?! Now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago?\nNo no I don't think so.\nYeah yeah: I feel I know you brother very well.\nNo No: you mistaken me for somebody else.\nFrank-- - SHUT UP! Can't you see two men are talkin'?\nBut-- - Thought I told yo ass to get to walkin'!\nNow I think y'all better leave this place:\n'Cause I'm about to catch a case.\n\nYour contagious: touch me baby give me what you got\n(Then a man said)\nSexy lady drive me crazy: drive me wild\n(I just can't believe it)\n\nYour contagious: touch me baby give me what you got\nSexy lady: drive me crazy: drive me wild\nYour contagious: touch me baby give me what you got\nSexy lady: drive me crazy: drive me wild",

(\"just like music\")\nTo keep me flowin and keep me goin'\nAnd keep me growin': and keep me the E from knowin'\nWhat happens out there: is not my concern\nYou wanna die it's not my turn (\"just like music\")\nTo do somethin' to me like jump in the Mercedes\nOn the highway: doin' over eighty\nWithout music baby... (\"Oww! I'll go crazy... just like music\")\nMake me call my homey on the phone\nLike there's somethin' new out: that got me in the zone\nJust that feelin': got me\nI wish music can adopt me (\"just like music\")\n\n(Chorus: Marvin Gaye)\nTurn on some music: I got my music\nTurn on some music: I got my music\nTurn on some music: I got my music\nTurn on some music: I got my music - just like music\n\nPut me in the mood with my woman\nGot me in the ear: sayin' sweet nothings\nMake love come out the mouth: no frontin\nLike all of a sudden: (\"just like music\")\nTakin' away your worries and cares\nAny problems: music'll be right there\nTogether match yo: we a perfect pair\nIs that true Marvin? (\"Yeah! Music\")\nYo: to get you to bang this\nBody soul-snatcher: universal language\nIt be the light: so open up\nThis is it: what the fuck? (\"just like music\")\nOne fly tune\nThat have black and white vibe in one room\nNo confrontation: parlay all night\nIt's just the sensation (\"just like music\")\n\n(Marvin Gaye)\nMusic is the soul of the man\nMusic makes a: happy day\nMusic makes a: cloud flow by baby\nYour music is my tears in-side my eyes (just like music)\nYour music makes me want to sing\nGirl music: is a joy to bring (just like music)\nMusic is my heart and soul: more precious than gold\n(Turn on some music: I got my music)\nHappiness for days: justice all the way\n(Turn on some music: I got my music)\nI love your music baby (I got my music)\n(Turn on some music: I got my music - just like music)\nHey (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dah) doo-doo: doo-doo-doo\nTurn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music\nJust like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dah) doo-doo: doo-doo-doo\nTurn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music\nJust like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dah) doo-doo: doo-doo-doo\nTurn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music\nJust like music...\n\n{*Fades out*}",

I fell in love\nFor the first time in my life.\nOh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.\n\nTo this day I still taste that first kiss.\nHow I prayed it wouldn't end:\nAnd in a way seeing you like this\nI guess it never really did.\n\nWe sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car:\nMade a wish on every star\nIn that clear September sky.\nOne bottle of wine and two dixie cups:\nThree A.M. I fell in love\nFor the first time in my life.\nOh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.\n\nOne bottle of wine and two dixie cups:\nThree A.M. I fell in love\nFor the first time in my life\nOh that's somethin'\nBaby that's somethin'\nOh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice\nOh yeah\n\nWe sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car:\nMade a wish on every star\n\nOne bottle of wine and two dixie cups:\nYeah we fell in love",

Yeah\n\nNow in dreams we run\n\nShe spends her days up in the north park\nWatching the people as they pass\nAnd all she wants is just a little piece of this dream\nIs that too much to ask?\nWith a safe home and a warm bed on a quiet little street\nAll she wants is just that something to hold on to\nThat's all she needs: yeah\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that: what would I do?\nWhat would I do? Yeah\n\nI'm falling into this: in dreams we run away\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that: what would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that: what would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nIf I can be like that \nI would give anything\nJust to live one day\nIn those shoes\nIf I can be like that: what would I do?\nWhat would I do?\n\nFalling in\nI feel I am falling in to this again",
