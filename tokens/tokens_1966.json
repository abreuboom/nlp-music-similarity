(Ooh-ooh-ooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nNow you don't really want me\nYou just keep me hangin' on\n\nYou say although we broke up\nYou still wanna be just friends\nBut how can we still be friends\nWhen seeing you only breaks my heart again?\nAnd there ain't nothing I can do about it\n\nWhoa-whoa-whoa\nSet me free: why don't you: baby?\nWhoa-whoa-whoa\nGet out my life: why don't you: baby? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nSet me free: why don't you: baby?\nGet out my life: why don't you: baby?\n\nYou claim you still care for me\nBut your heart and soul needs to be free\nNow that you've got your freedom\nYou wanna still hold on to me\nYou don't want me for yourself\nSo let me find somebody else: hey\n\nWhy don't you be a man about it\nAnd set me free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nNow: you don't care a thing about me\nYou're just using me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nGo on: get out: get out of my life\nAnd let me sleep at night (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\n'Cause you don't really love me\nYou just keep me hangin' on",

Things are OK\nBut I know that they're not\nAnd I still may have lost you\n\nWoman: do you love me?\nWoman: if you need me then\nBelieve me I need you\nTo be my woman\n\nI guess you'll take your time and tell me\nWhen we're alone: love will come home\nI would give up my world\nIf you'll say that my girl is my woman\n\nI've got plenty of time\nJust to get through it\nOnce again you'll be mine\nI still think we can do it\nAnd you know how much I love you\n\nWoman: don't forsake me\nWoman: if you take me then\nBelieve me I'll take you\nTo be my woman",
