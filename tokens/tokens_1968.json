        "Lyrics": "Bonnie and Clyde were pretty looking people\nBut I can tell you people\nThey were the devil's children\nBonnie and Clyde began their evil doing\nOne lazy afternoon down Savannah way\nThey robbed a store\nAnd hightailed out of that town\nGot clean away in a stolen car\nAnd waited till the heat died down\n\nBonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation\nAnd made the graduation\nInto the banking business\n\"Reach for the sky\" sweet-talking Clyde would holler\nAs Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag\nNow one brave man: he tried to take 'em alone\nThey left him lying in a pool of blood\nAnd laughed about it all the way home.\n\nBonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one\nRunning and hiding from every American lawman's gun\nThey used to laugh about dying\nBut deep inside 'em they knew\nThat pretty soon they'd be lying\nBeneath the ground together\nPushing up daisies to welcome the sun\nAnd the morning dew\n\nActing upon reliable information\nA federal deputation laid a deadly ambush\nWhen Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine\nA half a dozen carbines opened up on them\n\nBonnie and Clyde\nThey lived a lot together\nAnd finally together\nThey died",

And take some of them...\n\nGreen alligators and long necked geese:\nSome humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees:\nSome cats and rats and elephants: but sure as you're born:\nDon't you forget My Unicorn.\"\n\nOld Noah was there to answer the call:\nHe finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin'.\nHe marched in the animals two by two:\nAnd he called out as they went through: \"Hey Lord: I got your...\"\n\nGreen alligators and long necked geese:\nSome humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees:\nSome cats and rats and elephants: but Lord I'm so forlorn:\nI just can't see no Unicorn.\"\n\nThen Noah looked out through the driving rain:\nThem Unicorns were hiding: playing silly games.\nKicking and splashing while the rain was pouring:\nOh them silly Unicorns.\n\nThere was green alligators and long necked geese:\nSome humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees:\nNoah cried \"Close the door: cause the rain is pouring:\nAnd we just can't wait for no Unicorn.\"\n\nThe ark started movin: it drifted with the tide.\nThem Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried:\nAnd the waters came down and sort of floated them away:\nAnd that's why you never seen a Unicorn... to this very day.\n\nYou'll see green alligators and long necked geese:\nSome humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees:\nSome cats and rats and elephants: but sure as you're born:\nYou're never gonna see no Unicorn.",

Ah\nNinety days: thirty days for boogaloo\nThirty days to learn how to shing-a-ling\nAnd thirty more for the Afro twist\nCan't dance: what is this\nCourt's in session everybody quiet now\nCourt's in session: here comes the judge\nHere comes the judge\n \nIs that the man?\nNo: your honor\nDoes he look like the man?\nNo: your Honor\nWell: I'm sorry you got to go now\nAh ha you can't recognize the man\nYou got to stand guilty\nHere comes the judge\nHere comes the judge\nHere comes the judge\nAh yes: here comes the judge\nThey caught him stompin' down the aisle\nYes here comes the judge\nI'd rather be lost in the jungle of Brazil\nThan to face the judge\nThis morning the way he feels\nHere comes the judge\nHere comes the judge boy",
