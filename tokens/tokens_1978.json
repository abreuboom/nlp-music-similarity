Ain't there nothing left for me?\n\nBaby come back: oh darling: any kind of fool could see\nThere was something in everything about you\nBaby come back: listen baby: you can blame it all on me\nI was wrong and I just can't live without you\nI was wrong and I just can't live",

        "Lyrics": "I'm sailing away\nSet an open course for the virgin sea\n'Cause I've got to be free\nFree to face the life that's ahead of me\n\nOn board: I'm the captain\nSo climb aboard\nWe'll search for tomorrow\nOn every shore\nAnd I'll try: oh Lord: I'll try\nTo carry on\n\nI look to the sea\nReflections in the waves spark my memory\nSome happy: some sad\nI think of childhood friends and the dreams we had\n\nWe lived happily forever\nSo the story goes\nBut somehow we missed out\nOn the pot of gold\nBut we'll try best that we can\nTo carry on\n\nA gathering of angels\nAppeared above my head\nThey sang to me this song of hope\nAnd this is what they said: they said\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me: lads\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me: baby\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me\n\nI thought that they were angels\nBut to my surprise\nWe climbed aboard their starship\nWe headed for the skies: singing\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me: lads\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me\nCome sail away: come sail away: come sail away with me\nCome sail away: come sail away",
