I'm askin' you\nYou can't fool me 'cause I'm gonna know if you hide\nAnd try to peek: I'm gonna treat you to a movie\nStop your gigglin': children do be nice like little sugars and spice\n\nYou saw me kissin' your sister\nYou saw me holdin' her hand\nBut if you snitch to your mother\nYour father won't understand\n\nI wish they would take a nap: little children\nNow why don't you go bye-bye? Go anywhere at all\nLittle children: I know you would go if you tried\nGo up the stairs: me and your sister: we're goin' steady\nHow can I kiss her when I'm ready to with little children like you around?\nI wonder what can I do around little children like you",

Let's ask her.\nBetty: is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?\nMm-hmm\nGee: it must be great riding with him\nIs he picking you up after school today?\nUh-uh\nBy the way: where'd you meet him?\n\nI met him at the candy store\nHe turned around and smiled at me\nYou get the picture? (yes: we see)\nThat's when I fell for the leader of the pack\n\nMy folks were always putting him down (down: down)\nThey said he came from the wrong side of town\n(Whatcha mean when ya say that he came from the wrong side of town?)\nThey told me he was bad\nBut I knew he was sad\nThat's why I fell for the leader of the pack\n\nOne day my dad said: \"Find someone new\"\nI had to tell my Jimmy we're through\n(Whatcha mean when ya say that ya better go find somebody new?)\nHe stood there and asked me why\nBut all I could do was cry\nI'm sorry I hurt you the leader of the pack\n\nHe sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye\nThe tears were beginning to show\nAs he drove away on that rainy night\nI begged him to go slow\nBut whether he heard: I'll never know\n\nLook out! Look out! Look out! Look out!\n\nI felt so helpless: what could I do?\nRemembering all the things we'd been through\nIn school they all stop and stare\nI can't hide the tears: but I don't care\nI'll never forget him: the leader of the pack\n\nThe leader of the pack - now he's gone\nThe leader of the pack - now he's gone\nThe leader of the pack - now he's gone\nThe leader of the pack - now he's gone",
