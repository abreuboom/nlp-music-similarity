(Can you hear me? I know it sounds absurd)\nI know it sounds absurd (Won't you help me? Tell me who I am)\nBut please tell me who I am\nWho I am\nWho I am\nWho I am: yeah\n\nWoo!\nHey!\n'Cause I'm feeling so logical\nHey!\nD-d-d-d-d-d-d-digital\nYeah: one: two: three: five\nOoh: uh: uh: uh: yeah\nOoh: it's getting unbelievable\nYeah\nOoh",

No: child: no\n\nThe devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\nAnd he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet\nJohnny said: \"Devil: just come on back if you ever wanna try again\nAnd I've told: you once you son of a bitch: I'm the best there's ever been\"\n\nAnd he played Fire on the Mountain: run: boys: run\nThe devil's in the house of the rising sun\nThe chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough\nGranny: does your dog bite? No: child: no",

(Yes: I understand.)\nCan you feel it's right? (I know it is.)\nWill you be the same? (I'll do it all again.)\n\nIt's been a year now and it's getting so much better:\nYou came home without a word.\nThough everybody said you'll soon forget her:\nThey couldn't see it and they just didn't understand:\nAnd lookin' in the mirror: there were fools at either hand.\n\nYou shine a little love on my life.\nYou shine a little love on my life.\nYou shine a little love on my life and let me see.\n\nCan you understand? (Yes: I understand.)\nCan you feel it's right? (I know it is.)\nWill you be the same? (I'll do it all again.)\n\nHow many days had I been waiting there to tell you:\nI really can't believe.\nWe're walkin' out into the world tonight:\nWe'll do it all again until the break of night:\nAnd the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes.\n\nYou shine a little love on my life.\nYou shine a little love on my life.\nYou shine a little love on my life and let me see.\n\nYou shine a little love on my life (shine on me).\nYou shine a little love on my life (oh: oh: oh).\nYou shine a little love on my life and let me see.\n\nYou shine a little love on my life (shine).\nYou shine a little love on my life (E.L.O.).\nYou shine a little love on my life and let me see.",

        "Lyrics": "Do you remember\nThe 21st night of September?\nLove was changing the minds of pretenders\nWhile chasing the clouds away\n\nOur hearts were ringing\nIn the key that our souls were singing\nAs we danced in the night: remember\nHow the stars stole the night away\n\nBa de ya: say: do you remember\nBa de ya: dancing in September?\nBa de ya: never was a cloudy day\n\nBa du-da: ba du-da: ba du-da: ba-du\nBa du-da: ba-du: ba du-da: ba-du\nBa du-da: ba-du: ba du-da: yeah\n\nMy thoughts are with you\nHolding hands with your heart\nTo see you: only blue talk and love: remember\nHow we knew love was here to stay\n\nNow December found the love\nWe shared in September\nOnly blue talk and love: remember\nThe true love we share today\n\nBa de ya: say: do you remember\nBa de ya: dancing in September?\nBa de ya: never was a cloudy day\n\nAnd we say: ba de ya: say: do you remember\nBa de ya: dancing in September?\nBa de ya: golden dreams were shiny days\n\nNow our bell was ringing: aha\nOur souls were singing\nDo you remember every cloudy day: yow\n\nAnd we say ba de ya: say: do you remember\nBa de ya: dancing in September?\nBa de ya: never was a cloudy day\n\nAnd we say ba de ya: say: do you remember\nBa de ya: dancing in September?\nBa de ya: golden dreams were shiny days\n\nBa de ya: de ya: de oh\nBa de ya: de ya: de oh\nBa de ya: de ya: de oh: de ay\n\nBa de ya: de ya: de oh\nBa de ya: de ya: de oh\nBa de ya: de ya: de oh: de ay",
