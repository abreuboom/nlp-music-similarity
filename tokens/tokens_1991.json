        "Lyrics": "Birds fly: they don't think twice\nThey simply spread their wings\nThe sun shines: it don't ask why\nOr what the whole thing means\n\nThe same applies to you and I\nWe never question that\nSo good: it's just understood\nAin't no conjecture\nJust a matter of fact\n\nLove is a wonderful thing\nMake ya smile through the pouring rain\nLove is a wonderful thing\nI'll say it again and again\nTurn your world into one sweet dream\nTake your heart and make it sing\nLove: love is a wonderful thing\n\nThe only thing a river knows\nIs runnin' to the sea\nAnd every spring when a flower grows\nIt happens naturally\n\nThe same magic when you're in my arms\nNo logic can define\nDon't know why: just feels so right\nI only know it happens every time\n\nLove is a wonderful thing\nMake ya smile through the pouring rain\nLove is a wonderful thing\nI'll say it again and again\nTurn your world into one sweet dream\nTake your heart and make it sing\nLove: love is a wonderful thing\n\nOh when the cold wind blows\nI know you're gonna be there to warm me\nThat's what keeps me goin'\nAnd our sweet love will keep on growin'\n\nLove is a wonderful thing\nMake ya smile through the pouring rain\nLove is a wonderful thing\nI'll say it again and again\nTurn your world into one sweet dream\nTake your heart and make it sing\nLove: love is a wonderful thing\n\nLove is a wonderful: wonderful thing\nLove is a wonderful: wonderful thing\nIt's what makes honey taste sweet\nIt's what makes your life complete",

What gives you the right\nTo put up a fence And keep me out Or to keep Mother Nature in\nIf God was here He'd tell it to your face Man You're some kind of sinner\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this: don't do that\nCan't you read the sign\n\nOh Say now mister Can't you read\nYou got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat\nYou can't watch No You can't eat You ain't supposed to be here\n\nAnd the sign says \"You got to have a membership card to get inside\" Huh\n\nAnd the sign says \"Everybody welcome Come in Kneel down and pray\"\nBut then they passed around a plate at the end of it all\nAnd I didn't have a penny to pay\nSo I got me a pen and paper And I made up my own little sign\nI said Thank you Lord for thinking about me I'm alive and doing fine\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this: don't do that\nCan't you read the sign\n\nSigns Signs\nEverywhere there's signs\nFucking up the scenery\nBreaking my mind\nDo this: don't do that\nCan't you read the sign",

A prettier face\nBrand new clothes and a big fat place\nOn your rock and roll TV\nBut today the way I play the game is not the same\nNo way\nThink I'm gonna get me some happy\n\nI think there's something you should know\nI think it's time I told you so\nThere's something deep inside of me\nThere's someone else I've got to be\nTake back your picture in a frame\nTake back your singing in the rain\nI just hope you understand\nSometimes the clothes do not make the man\n\nAll we have to do now\nIs take these lies and make them true somehow\nAll we have to see\nIs that I don't belong to you\nAnd you don't belong to me\nFreedom\nYou've gotta give for what you take\nFreedom\nYou've gotta give for what you take\n\nHeaven knows we sure had some fun boy\nWhat a kick just a buddy and me\nWe had every big shot good-time band on the run boy\nWe were living in a fantasy\nWe won the race\nGot out of the place\nI went back home got a brand new face\nFor the boys on MTV\nBut today the way I play the game has got to change\nOh yeah\nNow I'm gonna get myself happy\n\nI think there's something you should know\nI think it's time I stopped the show\nThere's something deep inside of me\nThere's someone I forgot to be\nTake back your picture in a frame\nDon't think that I'll be back again\nI just hope you understand\nSometimes the clothes do not make the man\n\nAll we have to do now\nIs take these lies and make them true somehow\nAll we have to see\nIs that I don't belong to you\nAnd you don't belong to me\nFreedom\nYou've gotta give for what you take\nFreedom\nYou've gotta give for what you take\n\nWell it looks like the road to heaven\nBut it feels like the road to hell\nWhen I knew which side my bread was buttered\nI took the knife as well\nPosing for another picture\nEverybody's got to sell\nBut when you shake your ass\nThey notice fast\nAnd some mistakes were built to last\n\nThat's what you get\n\nI say that's what you get\n\nThat's what you get for changing your mind\n\nAnd after all this time\nI just hope you understand\nSometimes the clothes\nDo not make the man\n\nI'll hold on to my freedom\nMay not be what you want from me\nJust the way it's got to be\nLose the face now\nI've got to live",

Let me know\n'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so\nGot no time for silly games: that ain't even why I came\n'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like\n\nPlease understand the way I feel\nI must have trust or there's no deal\nMy emotion's ain't to be\nPlayed with or given free\nI appreciate greatly\nThe way you toleratered me\nSometimes I do act flaky\nI wouldn't blame you if you hate me\nYou put up with my butt\nWhen I wouldn't give it up\nYeah: I know that really sucks\nBut if you wait awhile: I'll make it up\n\nDo you really want me: baby? Let me know\n'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so\nGot no time for silly games: that ain't even why I came\n'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like\n\nWho me? A tease? Brother: please\nYou're just having bad memories\nAbout some skeeze who did the squeeze\nAnd had you on your hands and knees\nLook: I am telling you straight out\nThat's not what I'm all about\nI'd just be playing myself out\nIf I spent the night at your house\nNow don't get me wrong\nI didn't mean to turn you on\nWe haven't known each other long\nBut this is my life not just a song\n\nDo you really want me: baby? Let me know\n'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so\nGot no time for silly games: that ain't even why I came\n'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like",
