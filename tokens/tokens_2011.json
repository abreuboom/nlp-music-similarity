        "Lyrics": "There's a fire starting in my heart\nReaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark\n\nFinally: I can see you crystal clear\nGo ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare\n\nSee how I'll leave with every piece of you\nDon't underestimate the things that I will do\n\nThere's a fire starting in my heart\nReaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark\n\nThe scars of your love remind me of us\nThey keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all\n\nThe scars of your love: they leave me breathless\nI can't help feeling\n\nWe could have had it all\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nAnd you played it to the beat\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nBaby: I have no story to be told\nBut I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn\n\nThink of me in the depths of your despair\nMake a home down there as mine sure won't be shared\n\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nThe scars of your love remind me of us\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\nThey keep me thinking that we almost had it all\n\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nThe scars of your love: they leave me breathless\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\nI can't help feeling\n\nWe could have had it all\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nAnd you played it to the beat\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nCould have had it all\nRolling in the deep\n\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\nBut you played it with a beating\n\nThrow your soul through every open door (Whoa ho ho oh)\nCount your blessings to find what you look for (Whoa oh oh oh)\n\nTurn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa ho ho oh)\nYou'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow\n\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nWe could have had it all\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nWe could have had it all\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nIt all: it all: it all\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nWe could have had it all\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nAnd you played it to the beat\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nCould have had it all\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep\n(Tears are gonna fall: rolling in the deep)\n\nYou had my heart inside of your hand\n(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\nBut you played it: you played it: you played it\nYou played it to the beat",

        "Lyrics": "Pitbull\nMe not working hard?\nYeah right picture that with a Kodak\nOr better yet: go to Times Square\nTake a picture of me with a Kodak\n\nTook my life from negative to positive\nI just want y'all to know that\nAnd tonight: let's enjoy life\nPitbull: Nayer: Ne-Yo: that's right\n\nNe-Yo\nTonight I want all of you tonight\nGive me everything tonight\nFor all we know we might not get tomorrow\nLet's do it tonight\n\nNayer\nDon't care what they say\nAll the games they play\nNothing is enough\nTill they handle love (let's do it tonight)\nI want you tonight\nI want you to stay\nI want you tonight\n\nNe-Yo\nGrab somebody sexy: tell 'em hey (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\n\nPitbull\nTake advantage of tonight\n'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess\nBut tonight I can make you my queen\nAnd make love to you endless\n\nIt's insane the way the name growin' money keep flowin'\nHustlers move in silence so I'm tip-toein' to keep blowin'\nI got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan\n\nPut it on my life baby\nI'll make you feel right baby\nCan't promise tomorrow\nBut I promise tonight... dale!\n\nExcuse me\nIf I might drink a little more than I should tonight\nAnd I might take you home with me if I could tonight\nAnd baby: I'mma make you feel so good tonight\n'Cause we might not get tomorrow\n\nNe-Yo\nTonight I want all of you tonight\nGive me everything tonight\nFor all we know we might not get tomorrow\nLet's do it tonight\n\nNayer\nDon't care what they say\nAll the games they play\nNothing is enough\nTill they handle love (let's do it tonight)\nI want you tonight\nI want you to stay\nI want you tonight\n\nNe-Yo\nGrab somebody sexy: tell 'em hey (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\n\nPitbull\nReach for the stars\nAnd if you don't grab 'em at least you'll fall on top of the world\nThank about it 'cause if you slip\nI'm gon' fall on top of your girl (ha ha)\n\nWhat I'm involved in is deeper than the Mason's\nBaby baby: and it ain't no secret\nMy family's from Cuba\nBut I'm an American Idol gettin' money like Seacrest\n\nPut it on my life baby\nI'll make you feel right baby\nCan't promise tomorrow\nBut I promise tonight... dale!\n\nExcuse me\nIf I might drink a little more than I should tonight\nAnd I might take you home with me if I could tonight\nAnd baby I'mma make you feel so good tonight\n'Cause we might not get tomorrow\n\nNe-Yo\nTonight I want all of you tonight\nGive me everything tonight\nFor all we know we might not get tomorrow\nLet's do it tonight\n\nNayer\nDon't care what they say\nAll the games they play\nNothing is enough\nTill they handle love (let's do it tonight)\nI want you tonight\nI want you to stay\nI want you tonight\n\nNe-Yo\nGrab somebody sexy: tell 'em hey (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\nGive me everything tonight (hey)\n\nPitbull\nExcuse me\nIf I might drink a little more than I should tonight\nAnd I might take you home with me if I could tonight\nAnd baby I'mma make you feel so good tonight\n'Cause we might not get tomorrow",

Let's go\n\nSee the way we all in it: we all up in the race\nAnd you know we gotta go: now try to keep up with the pace\nAnd we strugglin' and hustlin' I said it and I get it\nAnd always gotta do it take it to another place\n\nGotta taste it and I gotta grab it\nAnd I gotta cut all through this traffic\nJust to be at the top of the throne\nBetter know I gotta have it. Have it\n\nChris Brown:\nLook at me now: look at me now\nOh: I'm gettin' paper\nLook at me now: oh: look at me now\nYeah: fresh than a muthafucker\n\nLil Wayne:\nMan fuck these bitch ass niggas. How y'all doin'?\nI'm Lil' Tunechi: I'm a nuisance\nI go stupid: I go dumb like the 3 Stooges\nI don't eat sushi: I'm the shit: no I'm pollution: no substitution\n\nGot a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi: pussy juicy\nI never gave a fuck about a hater: got money on my radar\nDress like a skater: got a big house came with a elevator\nYou niggas ain't eatin'\n\nFuck it: tell a waiter\nMarty said shoot 'em and I said okay\nIf you wanted bullshit then I'm like ole\nI don't care what you say: so don't even speak\n\nYour girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil\nThat's word to my flag and my flag red\nI'm out of my head: bitch: I'm out of my mind: from the bottom I climb\nYou ain't hotter than mine: nope\n\nNot on my time and I'm not even tryin'\nWhat's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five\nAnd if they trippin' fuck 'em five\nI ain't got no time to shuck and jive\n\nThese niggas: they sweet as pumpkin pie\nCiroc and Sprite on a private flight\nBitch I'm enticin' guidin' light\nAnd my pockets right and my diamonds white\n\nAnd my mama's nice and my daddy's dead\nYou faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild: been here for a while\nI was like fuck trial: I puts it down\nI'm so Young Money: if you got eyes look at me now: bitch\n\nChris Brown:\nLook at me now: look at me now\nOh: I'm gettin' paper\nLook at me now: oh: look at me now\nYeah: I'm fresher than a muthafucker\n\nOkay\nOkay\nIs that right?\nI'm fresher than a muthafucker",

(turn it up)\nAnd crank it higher every time they told you to stop?\n\nAnd all I ask is that you don't get mad at me\nWhen you have to purchase mad D batteries\nAppreciate every mixtape your friends make\nYou never know: we come and go like on the interstate\n\nI think finally found a note to make you understand\nIf you can hear this: sing along and take me by the hands\nKeep me stuck inside your head: like your favorite tune\nAnd know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you\n\nMy heart's a stereo\nIt beats for you: so listen close\nHear my thoughts in every note\nO-oh\n\nMake me your radio\nAnd turn me up when you feel low\nThis melody was meant for you\nSo sing along to my stereo\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh: to my stereo\nOh oh oh oh: so sing along to my stereo\n\nI only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)\nBecause good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)\nI'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)\nThought love was dead: but now you're changing my mind (yeah: yeah c'mon!)\n\nMy heart's a stereo\nIt beats for you: so listen close\nHear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (oh: oh)\n\nMake me your radio\nAnd turn me up when you feel low\nThis melody was meant for you\nSo sing along to my stereo\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh: to my stereo\nOh oh oh oh: so sing along to my stereo\n\nIt's ya boy Travie\nGym Class Heroes: baby!\n\nSo sing along to my stereo\n\nYeah!",

Damn)\nHow do I respond?\n\nWhat if my son stares with a face like my own\nAnd says he wants to be like me when he's grown\nDamn: but I ain't finished growin'\nAnother night the inevitable prolongs\n\nAnother day: another dawn\nJust tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'\nAnother lie that I carry on\nI need to get back to the place I belong\n\n(Skylar)\nI'm coming home: I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home: I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming\n\n(Diddy)\n\"A house Is Not A Home\": I hate this song\nIs a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?\nAnd people got the nerve to blame you for it\nAnd you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it\n\nBut you felt it and still feel it\nAnd money can't make up for it or conceal it\nBut you deal with it and you keep ballin'\nPour out some liquor: play boy: and we keep ballin'\n\nBaby: we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love\nBut we've been living as friends\nSo you've been a guest in your own home\nIt's time to make your house your own: pick up your phone: come on\n\n(Skylar)\nI'm coming home: I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home: I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming\n\n(Diddy)\n\"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\": I love that song\nWhenever it comes on it makes me feel strong\nI thought I told y'all that we won't stop\nTill back cruising through Harlem: Viso blocks\n\nIt's what made me: saved me: drove me crazy\nDrove me away than embraced me: forgave me\nFor all of my shortcomings: welcome to my homecoming\nYeah it's been a long time coming\n\nLot of fights: lot of scars\nLot of bottles: lot of cars\nLot of ups: lot of downs\nMade it back: lost my dog\n(I miss you Big)\n\nAnd here I stand: a better man\n(A better man)\nThank you Lord\n(Thank you Lord)\n\n(Skylar)\nI'm coming home: I'm coming home\nTell the world I'm coming home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm coming home: I'm coming home\nTell the world that I'm coming",

I can hardly decide.\nI can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised: I swear\n\nDaaamn: this one for the books: man!\nI swear this shit is as fun as it looks: man!\nI'm really tryin' to make it more than what it is:\n'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives! (Ooh!)\n\nNicki Minaj:\nI wish that I could have this moment for life: for life: for life\n'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive: alive: alive\nI wish that I could have this moment for life: for life: for life\n'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive: alive: alive\n\nThis is my moment: I waited all my life I can tell it's time\nDrifting away I'm one with the sunsets: I have become alive\n\nI wish that I could have this moment for life: for life: for life\n'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive: alive: alive\nI wish that I could have this moment for life: for life: for life\n'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive: alive: alive",

        "Lyrics": "Skylar Grey:\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long\nI'm running out of time\nI need a doctor: call me a doctor\nI need a doctor: doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\nEminem:\nI told the world: one day I would pay it back\nSay it on tape and lay it: record it so that one day I could play it back\nBut I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that\nDoubt's startin' to creep in: every day is just so gray and black\n\nHope: I just need a ray of that\n'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em: they just say it's whack\nBut they don't know what dope is: and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this\nAll I know is: you came to me when I was at my lowest\n\nYou picked me up: breathed new life in me: I owe my life to you\nBut for the life of me: I don't see why you don't see like I do\nBut it just dawned on me you lost a son: demons fightin' you\nIt's dark: let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you\n\nI don't think you realize what you mean to me: not the slightest clue\n'Cause me and you were like a crew: I was like your sidekick you\nGon' either wanna fight: when I get off this fuckin' mic or you\nGon' hug me: but I'm out of options: there's nothin' else I can do: 'cause\n\nSkylar Grey:\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long\nI'm running out of time\nI need a doctor: call me a doctor\nI need a doctor: doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\nEminem:\nIt hurts when I see you struggle: you come to me with ideas\nYou say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled: 'cause the shit I hear is\nCrazy: but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more\nSeems like your own opinions: not one you can form\n\nCan't make a decision: you keep questionin' yourself\nSecond guessin': and it's almost like your beggin' for my help\nLike I'm your leader: you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor\nI can endure: no more I demand you remember who you are\n\nIt was you: who believed in me: when everyone was tellin' you\nDon't sign me: everyone at the fuckin' label: let's tell the truth\nYou risked your career for me: I know it as well as you\nNobody wanted to fuck with the white boy: Dre I'm cryin' in this booth\n\nYou saved my life: now maybe it's my turn to save yours\nBut I could never repay you: what you did for me is way more\nBut I ain't givin' up faith: and you ain't givin' up on me\nGet up Dre: I'm dyin' I need you: come back for fuck's sake: 'cause\n\nSkylar Grey:\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long\nI'm running out of time\nI need a doctor: call me a doctor\nI need a doctor: doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\nBring me back to life\nBring me back to life\nI need a doctor: doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\nDr. Dre:\nIt literally feels like a lifetime ago\nBut I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday: though\nYou walked in: yellow jump suit: whole room cracked jokes\nOnce you got inside the booth: told you: mic smoked\n\nWent through friends: some of 'em I put on: but they just left\nThey said they was ridin' to the death: but where the fuck are they now\nNow that I need them: I don't see none of them all I see is Slim\nFuck all you fair-weather friends: all I need is him\n\nFuckin' backstabbers: when the chips were down: you just laughed at us\nNow you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath: faggots\nYou gon' see us in our lab jackets: and ask where the fuck we been\nYou can kiss my indecisive ass crack: maggots\n\nAnd the crackers' ass: little Cracker Jack beat makin'\nWhack: ass-backwards producers: I'm back bastards\nOne more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags: and as I'm leavin'\nI'll guarantee they'll scream \"Dre don't leave us like that man:\" 'cause\n\nSkylar Grey:\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou've been gone for so long\nI'm running out of time\nI need a doctor: call me a doctor\nI need a doctor: doctor\nTo bring me back to life",

No one knows\nI realized: yeah: it was only just a dream\n\nI was at the top: and now it's like I&#x2019;m in the basement\nNumber one spot: now she found her a replacement\nI swear: now I can't take it\nKnowin' somebody's got my baby\nAnd now you ain't around: baby: I can't think\nI shoulda' put it down: shoulda' got that ring\n'Cause I can still feel it in the air\nSee her pretty face: run my fingers through her hair\n\nMy lover: my life\nMy shawty: my wife\nShe left me: I'm tight\n'Cause I know that it just ain't right\n\nI was thinkin' 'bout her: thinkin' 'bout me\nThinkin' 'bout us: what we gon' be\nOpened my eyes: yeah: it was only just a dream\nSo I traveled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realized: yeah: it was only just a dream\n\nWhen I be ridin': man: I swear I see her face at every turn\nTryin' to get my Usher on: but I can't let it burn\nAnd I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for\nMore and more I miss her: when will I learn?\nDidn't give her all my love: I guess now I got my payback\nNow I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby\nHey: she was so easy to love\nBut wait: I guess that love wasn't enough\nI'm going through it every time that I'm alone\nAnd now I'm missing: wishing she'd pick up the phone\nBut she made the decision that she wanted to move on\n'Cause I was wrong\n\nAnd I was thinkin' 'bout her: thinkin' 'bout me\nThinkin' 'bout us: what we gon' be\nOpened my eyes: yeah: it was only just a dream\nSo: I traveled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realized: yeah: it was only just a dream\n\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything\nI said: if you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything\n\nI was thinkin' 'bout her: thinkin' 'bout me\nThinkin' 'bout us: what we gon' be\nOpened my eyes: yeah: it was only just a dream\nSo: I traveled back down that road\nWill she come back?

I'd rather die\nWithout you and I\n\nC'mon!\nPut your drinks up!\n\nWe got a whole lot of money: but we still pay rent\n'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven\nThere's only three men that Imma serve my whole life\nIt's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ there's\n\nSomething: something about the chase\nSix whole years\nI'm a New York woman: born to run you down\nSo have my lipstick all over your face\nSomething: something about just knowing when it's right\n\nSo put your drinks up: for Nebraska\nFor Nebraska: Nebraska: I love you\n\nYou and I\nYou: you and I\nBaby! I rather die!\nWithout you and I\n\nYou and I\nYou: you and I\nNebraska!

Tell me how's your family\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good: busier than ever\nWe small talk: work and the weather\nYour guard is up: and I know why\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses: and I left them there to die\n\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December: turn around and make it all right\nI go back to December all the time\n\nThese days: I haven't been sleeping\nStaying up: playing back myself leavin'\nWhen your birthday passed: and I didn't call\nAnd I think about summer: all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\nAnd then the cold came\nThe dark days when fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love\nAnd all I gave you was \"Goodbye\"\n\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December: turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\nI miss your tanned skin: your sweet smile\nSo good to me: so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again: I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it: but I can't\nSo if the chain is on your door: I understand\n\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December...\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December: turn around and make it all right\nI'd go back to December: turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\nAll the time",

(yeah)\nWe're paying with love tonight\n\nIt's not about the money: money: money\nWe don't need your money: money: money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\nAin't about the (uh) cha-ching: cha-ching\nAin't about the (yeah) ba-bling: ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\n(Okay!)\nWe need to take it back in time\nWhen music made us all unite\nAnd it wasn't low blows and video hoes\nAm I the only one gettin' tired?\n\nWhy is everybody so obsessed?\nMoney can't buy us happiness\nCan we all slow down and enjoy right now?\nGuarantee we'll be feelin' all right\n\nEverybody look to the left: (to the left)\nEverybody look to the right: (to the right)\nCan you feel that? (yeah)\nWe're paying with love tonight\n\nIt's not about the money: money: money\nWe don't need your money: money: money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\nAin't about the (uh) cha-ching: cha-ching\nAin't about the (yeah) ba-bling: ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\nB.o.B:\nYeah: yeah\nWell: keep the price tag\nAnd take the cash back\nJust give me six strings and a hashtag\nAnd you can keep the cars\nLeave me the garage\nAnd all I...\nYes: all I need are keys and guitars\nAnd guess what: in thirty seconds: I'm leaving to Mars (Mars)\nYeah: we leaping across ('cross) these undefeatable odds\nIt's like this man: you can't put a price on a life\nWe do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night\nSo we ain't gon' stumble and fall: never\nWaiting to see or send a sign of defeat? Uh-uh\nSo we gon' keep everyone moving their feet\nSo bring back the beat and then everyone sing\n\nJessie J and B.o.B:\nIt's not about the money\n\nJessie J:\nMoney: money\nWe don't need your money: money: money\nWe just wanna make the world dance\nForget about the price tag\n\nAin't about the (uh) cha-ching: cha-ching\nAin't about the (yeah) ba-bling: ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance\nForget about the price (Hey) tag (Hey)\n\nIt's not about the money: money: money (We don't need it)\nWe don't need your money: money: money (I don't: we don't need it)\nWe just wanna make the world dance (dance: dance: dance)\nForget about the price tag\n\nAin't about the (yeah) cha-ching: cha-ching\nAin't about the (it ain't about whoo!) ba-bling: ba-bling\nWanna make the world dance (Yeah: yeah)\nForget about the price tag (Forget about the price tag)\n\nYeah: yeah\nOoh-ooh\nForget about the price tag",

        "Lyrics": "(Verse 1: Lil Wayne)\nI tell her \"Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga.\"\nI already know that life is deep: but I still dig her\nNiggas is jealous: but really I could care less\nI'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hairnet\n\nDevil on my shoulder: the Lord is my witness\nSo on my Libra scale: I'm weighing sins and forgiveness\nWhat goes around comes around like a hoola hoop\nKarma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful\n\nLife on the edge: I'm dangling my feet\nI tried to pay attention but attention paid me\nHaters can't see me: nose-bleed seats\nAnd today I went shopping and talk is still cheap\n\nI rock to the beat of my drum set\nI been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet\nBut I'm: Ray Charles to the bullshit\nNow jump up on that dick and do a full split!\n\n(Hook: Drake)\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back\nTold me \"Baby it's real.\"\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second: I squeeze it: I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go anywhere but here\nBaby you know the deal\n\n'Cause she bad: so maybe she won't but shit: then again: maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now: she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now: she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now: she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now: she will\n\n(Verse 2: Lil Wayne)\nAnd I tell her \"Go on! Pop that pussy for me.\"\nHaters can't see me but bitches still looking for me\nAnd you could take it to the bank and deposit that\nPut your two cents in and get a dollar back\nSome people hang you out to dry like a towel rack\nI'm all about \"I\" give the rest of the vowels back\n\nI like my girl thick: not just kinda fine\nEat her till she cry: call that \"wine and dine\"\nTry to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses\nThey say \"Choose wisely:\" that's why I was chosen\n\nRocking like the asphalt: it's the cash's fault\nLooked in the face of death and took it's mask off\nNow I like my house big and my grass soft\nI like my girl's face South and her ass North\nBut I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit\nNow hop up on my dick and do a full split!\n\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back\nTold me \"Baby it's real.\"\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second: I squeeze it: I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go anywhere but here\nBaby you know the deal\n\n'Cause she bad: so maybe she won't but shit: then again: maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now: she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now: she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now: she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now: she will",

One time for the West side: let me see them hands..)\nHands up in the air (boi)\n(Two times if you love G.O.O.D Music)\nHands up in the air (boi boi boi boi)\n(And 3 times for the baddest chick in the World who got her hands up in the air)\nHands up in the air (I do it)\n\nAnd I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this night up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this ass up: like it's my last\nSwear I'mma: swear I'mma do it like\nLike I never had it at all\n\nBig ass bottles: Big Ice buckets\nI work too hard to be ballin' on a budget\nMe and my people do it big out in public 'cause\n'Cause if you don't do it big: bitch: you ain't doing nothing\n\nAnd I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this night up like it's my last\nI'mma hit this ass up: like it's my last\nSwear I'mma: swear I'mma do it like\nLike I never had it at all\n\nD-Town.
