Yet? Yet? No: no\nYet? Yet? Yet? No: no\n\nIt's not like you didn't know that\nI said I love you and I swear I still do\nAnd it must have been so bad\n'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you\n\nAnd this is how you remind me of what I really am\nThis is how you remind me of what I really am\n\nIt's not like you to say sorry\nI was waiting on a different story\nThis time I'm mistaken\nFor handing you a heart worth breaking\n\nAnd I've been wrong: I've been down\nBeen to the bottom of every bottle\nThese five words in my head\nScream \"are we havin' fun yet?\"\n\nYet? Yet? Yet? No: no\nYet? Yet? Yet? No: no\nYet? Yet? Yet? No: no\nYet? Yet? Yet?

Diddy)\nGirl you made me believe again\nIf you happy then be with him: go 'head mommy breathe again\nGo 'head mommy breathe again: don't stop now straight to the top now\nGo 'head mommy make it hot now\nI need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now\nAnd what I need is simple: five foot five with dimples\nPotential wife credentials\nKnow about the life I'm into: life I've been through\nAnd how I had a trifilin mental\nSo ride with me: G Force fly with me\nTimes get hard cry with me: die with me\nWhite beach sands lye with me\nMy advice is forget the limelight\nLet's make love: while we listen to Frank White\nSo tight: now I understand life\n\n(Chorus: Ginuwine: Mario Winans & P. Diddy)\nWhat I need\n(P. Diddy: Yeah take that)\nIs a pretty woman next to me\n(Ginuwine: A pretty woman yeah baby)\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\n(P. Diddy: Dream with me: believe in me)\nMaybe we could start a family\n(Ginuwine: Start a family baby)\nSomeone who truly understands: how to treat a man\nThis is what I need\n\n(Verse 2: Loon)\nListen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma\nBeen a whole day now I want to lay 'round\nAnd sip coladas: dipped in Prada\nI'm smooth as Erik Estrada: dipped in dollars\nWe out in Vegas Nevada: bubble bath in the champagne glass\n'Bout the size of a campaign ad\nYou don't know how you look to me\nBut if love was a crime you be a crook to me\nCause mommy I've done been around the world: seened a lot of places\nBeen around your girl believe I read faces\nI can tell she don't want me prevail\nBut I: learn my lesson watchin Sean bless it\nSo why listen to her and start guessin?\nMommy you ain't ready to ride to start dressin\nI need a girl receive my mom's blessin\nConfession: my love no contestin\nI need affection\n\n Yes I need affection: let's go Mario!\n(Mario Winans)\nGirl what the hell is on your mind\nI could be dumb but I'm not blind\nThere's somethin' leakin in your mind\nDon't look to good for you and me: always did agree\nThat ain't what I need: baby!\n\n(Ginuwine and Mario Winans)\nWhat I need: is a pretty woman next to me\n(Mario Winans: Oh please baby)\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\n(Mario Winans: I need a girl in my life)\nMaybe we could start a family\n(Ginuwine: Start a family baby)\nSomeone who truly understands: how to treat a man\nThis is what I need\n\n(Verse 3: P. Diddy)\nAy yo the sun don't shine forever\nBut as long as were here then we might as well shine together\nNever mind the weather: go somewhere and get our minds together\nBuild a love that a last forever\nSo let's stop the pain: stop the rain\nPut: stress to rest girl stop the games\nName the spot: mommy I got the plane\nRoll through rough: I got the range\nMa I got some thangs: knowned to put rocks in rings\nPush a hundred foot yachts and thangs\nYour man don't play: have you ever bee to Sandro Pe?\nOr seened a brotha play Amando Lay?\nGirl I want to just: look in your eyes and watch the sunrise\nNo more lies: no more tears to cry\nNo more reasons for leavin': do I believe in?\nLove you till the day I stop breathin: I love you girl\n\n(Chorus: Ginuwine and Mario Winans)\nWhat I need: is a pretty woman next to me\n(Ginuwine: Standin next to me girl)\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\n(Ginuwine: When I wake up in the morning)\nMaybe we could start a family\n(Ginuwine: I want to see your pretty face: yeah)\nSomeone who truly understands: how to treat a man\nThis is what I need\n(Female singer: Is that all you want?)\nIs a pretty woman next to me\n(Female singer: Made the sacrifice)\nTo share the dreams that I believe\n(Female singer: And maybe maybe we)\nMaybe we could start a family\nSomeone who truly understands: how to treat a man\nThis is what I need: is a pretty woman next to me\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\nMaybe we could start a family\nSomeone who truly understands: how to treat a man\nThis is what I need",

Tonight he's waitin: and I ain't complainin\nI'm entertainin: my number one fan\nMy back is achin: from our love makin'\nOh yes I'm takin': ain't no use in fakin\nMy ups: my downs: my high and my lows\nFrom head to toe: he makes me glow\nHe hits the spot: he makes me hot\nI'm all that he's got: and he's all that I got\n\n(Chorus: Truth Hurts)\nHe's so contagious: he turns my pages\nHe's got me anxious: he's what I waited for\nHe keeps me guessin: spontaneous\nHe's so persuasive: and I'm his lady\n\n(Verse 3: Rakim)\nThinkin' of a masterplan: you know anything you need baby ask your man\nYou was there from a half a grand\nNow it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands\nWe ball like we own the world: your only concern is you my only girl\nAnd when we speakin' in tongues\nBreathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs\nKeep it strong: but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done\nIt's joy and pain: when you try to get ahead of the game\nIt's fucked up but you never complain\nYou just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood\nJust another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good\nNo more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts\nGettin' loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out\nJust me and you high off sex I'm twisted\nYou OG'd and you OD addicted\n\n(Chorus: Truth Hurts)\nHe's so contagious: he turns my pages\nHe's got me anxious: he's what I waited for\nHe keeps me guessin: spontaneous\nHe's so persuasive: and I'm his lady\nHe's so contagious: he turns my pages\nHe's got me anxious: he's what I waited for\nHe keeps me guessin: spontaneous\nHe's so persuasive: and I'm his lady",

Imma make you look so ridiculous now\n\nI'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry \nBut tonight: I'm cleanin' out my closet: one more time\n\nI said: I'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you \nI never meant to make you cry \nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet: ha\n\nI got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they throw me inside my coffin and close it: imma expose it\nI'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD\n\nI was a baby: maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch\n'Cause he split: I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo I don't owe him a second thought: I just fuckin' wished he would die\n\nI look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side\nEven if I hated Kim: I'd grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake: I maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human: but I'm man enough to face 'em today\n\nWhat I did was stupid: no doubt: it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun\n'Cause I'd have killed 'em: shit: I woulda shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life: I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show\n\nI'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry \nBut tonight: I'm cleanin' out my closet: one more time\n\nI said: I'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet\n\nNow I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen: 'fore you think this record is dissin'\nBut put yourself in my position: just try to envision\nWitnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen\n\nBitchin': that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'\nGoin' through public housin' systems: victim of M&#xFC;nchhausen's Syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick: when I wasn't\nTill I grew up: now I blew up: it makes you sick to ya stomach: doesn't it?\n\nWasn't it the reason you made that CD for me: ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me: ma?\nBut guess what: ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely\nAnd Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony\n\nAnd Hailie's getting so big now: you should see her: she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her: she won't even be at your funeral\nSee what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong\nBitch do your song: keep telling yourself: that you was a mom\n\nBut how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get\nYou selfish bitch: I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?\nWell guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!\n\nI'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry \nBut tonight: I'm cleanin' out my closet: one more time\n\nI said: I'm sorry mama\nI never meant to hurt you \nI never meant to make you cry \nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet",

        "Lyrics": "You could buy me diamonds: you could buy me pearls\nTake me on a cruise around the world\n(Baby: you know I'm worth it)\nDinner lit by candles: run my bubble bath\nMake love tenderly to last and last\n(Baby: you know I'm worth it)\n\nWanna please: wanna keep: wanna treat your woman right?\nNot just dough: better show that you know she's worth your time\nYou will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first\nShe will and she can find a man who knows her worth\n\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her\n(When he sees her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her\n(Please her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first\n(First)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth\n(A woman's worth)\n\n(Hold up)\n\nIf you treat me fairly I'll give you all my goods\nTreat you like a real woman should\n(Baby: I know you're worth it)\nIf you never play me: promise not to bluff\nI'll hold you down when shit gets rough\n('Cause baby: I know you're worth it)\n\nShe walks the mile: makes you smile: all the while being true\nDon't take for granted the passions that she has for you\nYou will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first\nShe will and she can find a man who knows her worth\n\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her\n(When he sees her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her\n(Please me)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first\n(First baby)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth\n\nNo need to read between the lines spelled out for you\n(Spelled out for you)\nJust hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value\n(When you value value)\nA woman's\nSay\n(Woman's)\nWoman's worth\n(Woman's)\nYea\n\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her\n(When he sees her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her\n(Please me)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first\n(First baby)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth\n(A woman's worth)\n\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her\n(Nothing like a woman's worth)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first\n(Comes first)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth\n(A woman's worth)\n\nCherish that woman: you better please that woman\nYeah",

No\nDidn't she mind? I don't think so\nWas it for real? Damn sure\nWhat was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24\nSo was she keen? She couldn't wait\nCinnamon queen? Let me update\nWhat did she say? She said she'd love to\nRendezvous\nShe asked me what we were gonna do\nSaid we'd start with a bottle of Mo&#xEB;t for two\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday: we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday: we chilled on Sunday\n\nNine was the time\n'Cause I'll be getting mine\nAnd she was looking fine\nSmooth talker: she told me\nShe'd love to unfold me all night long\nOoh: I loved the way she kicked it\nFrom the front to back she flipped it (Back she flipped it: the way she kicked it)\nAnd I oh: oh I yeah\nHope that she'd care\n'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh yeah)\nI'm not a man to play around baby (Ooh yeah)\n'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair\nFrom the first impression girl: hmm you don't seem to be like that\n'Cause there's no need to chat: for there'll be plenty time for that\nFrom the subway to my home\nEndless ringing of my phone\nWhen you're feeling all alone\nAll you gotta do: is just call me call me\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday: we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday: we chilled on Sunday\n\n(Break it down: break it down)\nSince I met this special lady\nOoh yeah\nI can't get her off my mind\nShe's one of a kind\nAnd I ain't about to deny it\nIt's a special kind of thing\nWith you\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday: we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday: we chilled on Sunday (Sunday Sunday Sunday)",

No\nYou can't fight it...\nIt's gonna get to your heart\n\nThere's no escaping love\nOnce the gentle breeze\nWeaves a spell upon your heart\nNo matter what you think\nIt won't be too long\nTill you're in my arms\n\nUnderneath the starlight: starlight\nWe'll be lost in the rhythm so right\nFeel it steal your heart tonight\n\nYou can try to resist\nTry to hide from my kiss\n\nBut you know: But you know\nThat you can't fight the moonlight\nDeep in the dark: you'll surrender your heart\nBut you know: but you know that you\nCan't fight the moonlight... No\nYou can't fight it...\nNo matter what you do\nThe light is gonna get to you\n\n(You're gonna know\nThat I know)\nDon't try: you're never gonna win: oh\n\nUnderneath the starlight: starlight\nThere's a magical feeling: so right\nIt'll steal your heart tonight\n\nYou can try to resist: try to hide from my kiss\nBut you know: but you know that you\nCan't fight the moonlight\nDeep in the dark: you'll surrender your heart\nBut you know: but you know that you\nCan't fight the moonlight\nNo: you can't fight it\n\nYou can try to resist: try to hide from my kiss\nBut you know: but you know that you\nCan't fight the moonlight\nDeep in the dark: you'll surrender your heart\nBut you know: but you know that you\nCan't fight the moonlight\nNo: you can't fight it\n\nIt's gonna get to your heart...",

        "Lyrics": "(Lil' Mo) Yeay!\n(Angie M) Oh yeah yeah\n(Lil' Mo) Yeay!\n(Angie M) Uh: woo! come on: uh\n(Lil' Mo) If I can go: with you\n(Angie M) Yo: yo: uh\n\n(Verse 1: Angie Martinez)\nIf I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away\nFrom here we could crossover like Hardaway\nSomewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today\nAnd I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay\nAnd: if I can go: with you\nThen I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool\nHave you ever been close to feelin' like leavin' the coast too\nFeelin' like leavin' with somebody who\nHold you the right way while watchin the night fade\nMake you feel like you right back in the ninth grade\nWhen you know what he likes and what he might say\nAnd you try to be calm and answer in nice ways\nAnd: if I can go: with you\nWay out the states no 2 ways and no page\nNo cells and no trace: and you just a phone call away\nSo all I got to say is\n\n(Chorus: Lil' Mo)\nIf I can go: contigo: I'll pack my things: soon as you say\nBaby vamos: we'll fly away: like there is no: no tomorrow\nIf can go: contigo: I'll tell my friends: nothing at all\nI'll get my things: soon as you say: baby vamos: we'll fly away\n\n(Verse 2: Sacario)\nAnd: if I can go: with you\nOh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed\nAnd cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys\nAnd boy with the block since around 94 boy\nAnd: if I can flow: with you\nHuggin Tato after the studio I roll with you\nI send Dutch and three other goons to go get you\nSacario the name hold weights the whole issue\nGrown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue\nThe way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official\nThem I'm takin' a trip too with no pistols\nCause everything peace only sand no streets\nLittle Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see\nTwo cups: one in Senado one in Sand Beach\nAnd: I'll think I'll go: with you\nSo tell the station you need a week back to you\n\n(Chorus: Lil' Mo)\nIf I can go: contigo: I'll pack my things: soon as you say\nBaby vamos: we'll fly away: like there is no: no tomorrow\nIf can go: contigo: I'll tell my friends: nothing at all\nI'll get my things: soon as you say: baby vamos: we'll fly away\n\n(Bridge: Lil' Mo)\nYou can fly away: no one has to know\nWill you take me with you: 'cause if I can go\nSoon as you say the word: we'll be on our way\nTo a foreign place: you got to tell me\n\n(Martinez Angie)\nYo: uh: so now that we got a plan are you comin'? We could plan a week\nThe only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?\n\n(Sacario)\nAnd a seat: know why? the window 'cause I like to see\nAnd seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak\n\n(Angie+S)\nAnd: since we 'bout to go: in a few\n\n(Sacario)\nGo 'head\n\n(Martinez Angie)\nOh: I just wanted to tell Trace thank you\nThat week off I'm grateful what was you tryin' to say boo?\n\n(Sacario)\nNuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too\n\n(Martinez Angie)\nOk: that little place it's a great move\nBut ain't no problems: unless the water don't stay blue\n\n(Sacario)\nAnd the shop's there?\n\n(Martinez Angie)\nIf they don't got em: they don't make em\n\n((Sacario:) True!)\nNo concrete just sand: throw away your shoes\nNow: that we are on: our way\nAnd our bags is packed and the car service is not late\nEverything's ok: so I guess I catch you on the next track\nNow I don't gotta ask\n\n(Chorus: Lil' Mo)\nIf I can go: contigo: I'll pack my things: soon as you say\nBaby vamos: we'll fly away: like there is no: no tomorrow\nIf I can go: contigo: I'll tell my friends: nothing at all\nI'll get my things: soon as you say: baby vamos: we'll fly away\n\n(Outro: Lil' Mo)\nIf I can go: contigo: I'll pack my things: soon as you say\nBaby vamos: we'll fly way: like there is no: no tomorrow\nAnd if I can go: contigo: I'll tell my friends: nothing at all\nNothing at all: I'll tell my friends: nothing at all",

(No)\nDo you think I meant to hurt u? (No)\nSo let's laugh together: cry together\nGod willin' we gon' die together\n\nIt's a brand new me: a brand new you\nA brand new day: sky so blue\nHold my hand while I walk with you\nSit on my lap: lemme talk to you\nNo more games callin' you foul names\nActin' like females is all the same\nI'm gon' love you better: my mentality changed\nFrom this day forward I'll never be the same\nI'ma rub your lower back: share my dreams\nI love you: lemme show you what I mean\nGive you the deepest love a girl ever seen\nWatch you sleep: so peaceful and serene\nA toast to the queen: you're back in my life\nBut this time I'ma do it right\nTrust me: from the bottom of my heart\nNothing's gonna tear us apart: promise",

(hey)\n\nIt's kinda special right: yeah\nYou know: if you think about it\nSometimes people are just destined\nDestined to do what they do\nAnd that's what it is\n\nNow everybody dance",

        "Lyrics": "He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug\nHe was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love\nHe had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear\nHe made my heart start palpatatin' every time he came near\nHe had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe\nHis pants was saggin he was plaided: and his hair was corn-rowed\nHe had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed\nHe tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go\n\nI do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\n'Cause I do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\nMe and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor\nIt's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show\nI shook my hips: took a dip: rolled my tongue 'cross my lips\nAnd when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips\nOn the small of my back: so I had to react\nLike I was playin' hard to get and told that boy to step back\nBut when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul\nI'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you: for sure\n\nI do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\n'Cause I do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\nWatch me drop: drop: shake it for the fellas who know\nWatch me pop: pop my hips as I dip and roll\nNow watch me stop: stop traffic as I walk through the room\nKnowin' all the pappi's want me but all I want is you\n\n(I do)\n\nWatch me drop: drop: shake it for the fellas who know\nWatch me pop: pop my hips as I dip and roll\nNow watch me stop: stop traffic as I walk through the room\nKnowin' all the poppi's want me but all I want is you\n\nI do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\n'Cause I do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\n'Cause I do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control\n\n'Cause I do: wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes: I entice you\nSo come on shorty if you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playah ballin out of control",
