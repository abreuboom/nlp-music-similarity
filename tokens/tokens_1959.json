        "Lyrics": "In 1814 we took a little trip\nAlong with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'\nWe took a little bacon and we took a little beans\nAnd we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans\n\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they began to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nWe looked down the river and we seed the British come\nAnd there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum\nThey stepped so high and they made their bugles ring\nWe stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing\n\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they began to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nOld Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise\nIf we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eye\nWe held our fire till we seed their faces well\nThen we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em\nWell we\n\nFired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they began to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nYeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles\nAnd they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go\nThey ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nWe fired our cannon till the barrel melted down\nSo we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round\nWe filled his head with cannonballs and powered his behind\nAnd when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind\n\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they began to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nYeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles\nAnd they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go\nThey ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nHup: 2: 3: 4\nSound off: 3: 4\nHup: 2: 3: 4\nSound off: 3: 4\nHup: 2: 3: 4\nSound off: 3: 4",

He disappeared: babe\nAfter drawin' out all his hard-earned cash\nAnd now Macheath spends just like a sailor\nCould it be our boy's done something rash?\n\nNow Jenny Diver: ho: ho: yeah: Sukey Tawdry\nOoh: Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown\nOh: the line forms on the right: babe\nNow that Macky's back in town\n\nI said Jenny Diver: whoa: Sukey Tawdry\nLook out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown\nYes: that line forms on the right: babe\nNow that Macky's back in town\n\nLook out ol' Macky's back",

Oh:\nBroken hearted melody\nWon't you bring him back to me\nSing to him until he hears:\nFor when he returns no more will he be:\nA broken hearted melody.",

        "Lyrics": "Narrative:\nDuring the North African campaign: a bunch of soldier boys had\nBeen on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The\nNext morning being Sunday: several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant\nCommanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer:\nThe text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took\nThem out: but this one boy had only a deck of cards: and so he spread\nThem out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said: \"Soldier: put away those\nCards.\" After the services was over: the soldier was taken prisoner and\nBrought before the Provost Marshall.\n\nThe Marshall said: \"Sergeant: why have you brought this man\nHere?\" \"For playing cards in church: Sir.\" \"And what have you to say for\nYourself: son?\" \"Much: Sir:\" replied the soldier. The Marshall said: \"I\nHope so: for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever\nPunished.\" The soldier said: \"Sir: I have been on the march for about six\nDays. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book: but I hope to satisfy\nYou: Sir: with the purity of my intentions.\" And with that: the boy\nStarted his story:\n\n\"You see Sir: when I look at the Ace: it reminds me that there\nIs but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into\nTwo parts: the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey: I think\nOf the Father: the Son: and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four: I\nThink of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew:\n\n\nMark: Luke and John. And when I see the Five: it reminds me of the five\nWise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were\nWise and were saved: five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the\nSix: it reminds me that in six days: God made this great heaven and\nEarth. When I see the Seven: it reminds me that on the seventh day: God\nRested from His great work. And when I see the Eight: I think of the\nEight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was\nNoah: his wife: their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine: I\nThink of the lepers our Savior cleansed: and nine out of the ten didn't\nEven thank Him. When I see the Ten: I think of the Ten Commandments God\nHanded down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King: it\nReminds me that there is but one King of Heaven: God Almighty. And when I\nSee the Queen: I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary: who is Queen of\nHeaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number\nOf spots on a deck of cards: I find 365: the number of days in a year.\nThere are 52 cards: the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits: the\nNumber of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards: the number of\nMonths in a year. There are 13 tricks: the number of weeks in a quarter.\nSo you see: Sir: my pack of cards serves me as a Bible: an Almanac and a\nPrayer Book.\"\n\n\"And friends: the story is true. I know: I was that soldier.\"",

Ain't got no friends to go our bail.\nSo: here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail.\n\nI was shooting dice: raking in the dough (long green) and then I heard a whistle blow.\nWe started to run when a man in blue said: \"Senor: come with me 'cause I want you.\"\n\nSo: here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail.\nSo: here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail.\n\nJust five hundred dollars and they'll set us free. I couldn't raise a penny if they threatened me.\nI know five hundred don't sound like much (cheap): but just try to find somebody to touch.\n\nSo: here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail.\nSo: here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail.\nSo: here we are in the Tijuana jail.

And then?)\n\nAck-ack\nAnd then along came Jones\nTall: thin Jones\nSlow-walkin' Jones\nSlow-talkin' Jones\nAlong came lonely: lanky Jones\n\nCommercial came on: so I got up to get myself a snack\nYou should've seen what was going on by the time that I got back\nDown in the old abandoned mine: sweet Sue was a-havin' fits\nThat villain said: \"Give me the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits\"\n\nAnd then he grabbed her (And then?)\nHe tied her up (And then?)\nHe lit the fuse to the dynamite (And then? And then?)\n\nAck-ack\nAnd then along came Jones\nTall: thin Jones\nSlow-walkin' Jones\nSlow-talkin' Jones\nAlong came lonely: lanky Jones\n\nI got so bugged: I turned it off and turned on another show\nBut there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo\nSalty Sam was a-tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack\nHe said: \"If you don't give me the deed to your ranch: I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track\"\n\nAnd then he grabbed her (And then?)\nHe tied her up (And then?)\nHe threw her on the railroad track (And then?)\nA train started coming (And then? And then?)\n\nAck-ack\nAnd then along came Jones\nTall: thin Jones\nSlow-walkin' Jones\nSlow-talkin' Jones\nAlong came lonely: lanky Jones\nAlong came lonely: lanky Jones",

Glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah!\nHis truth is marching on.\n\nI have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps\nThey have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps\nI can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps\nHis day is marching on.\n\nI have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel:\n\n\n\"As ye deal with my condemners: So with you my grace shall deal;\"\nLet the Hero: born of woman: crush the serpent with his heel\nSince God is marching on.\n\nHe has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat\nHe is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat\nOh: be swift: my soul: to answer Him! be jubilant: my feet!\nOur God is marching on.\n\nLn the beauty of the lillies Christ was born across the sea:\nWith a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:\nAs He died to make men holy: let us die to make men free:\nWhile God is marching on.",
