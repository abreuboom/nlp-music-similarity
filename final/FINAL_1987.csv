1,Bangles,Walk Like An Egyptian,"All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance: don't you know?
If they move too quick (oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh: ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink: then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh: ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street: bend your back
Shift your arm: then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs: cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh: ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian"
2,Heart,Alone,"I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here: the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh: I hope that it won't end though
Alone

'Til now: I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight
Oh: you don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Oh ooh oh
'Til now: I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone
Alone"
3,Gregory Abbott,Shake You Down,"Oh: yeah

Girl: I've been watching you
From so far across the floor now: baby
That's nothing new
I've watched you so many times before now: baby

I see that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And what it's telling me
And you know: oh girl: that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up on my telepathy: now baby

Girl: I've been missing you
And you know: it's funny
Every time I get to feelin' this way
I wish I had you near me
I wanna reach out and touch you

I can't stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me: baby: when I'm holding you
I shake and I shiver when I know your near
Then you whisper in my ear
Oh baby: well: oh well

(You read my mind) You know you did
(Girl: I wanna shake you down) Oh: baby

Aah: yeah (I can give you all the loving you need)
Roses are red and violets are blue
I'm gonna rock this town for you (come on: let me take you down)
Hey: baby (we'll go all the way to heaven)

Come on: sugar: let me shake you down
I'm gonna take you down to the ground
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Come on: baby: whisper in my ear

Come on: sugar: let me shake you down
I'm gonna take you down to the ground
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Come on: baby: whisper in my ear"
4,Whitney Houston,I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),"Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done all right up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls: loneliness calls

Oh: I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah: I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh: I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah: I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later: the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh: I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah: I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh: I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah: I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooh: somebody ooh
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooh: somebody ooh
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh: I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah: I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh: I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah: I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

5,Starship,Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now,"Looking in your eyes
I see a paradise
This world that I found
Is too good to be true

Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart
That I'm feeling for you

Let them say we're crazy
I don't care 'bout that

7,Whitesnake,Here I Go Again,"I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in the songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again
Here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord: I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone"
8,Bruce Hornsby and The Range,The Way It Is,"Standing in line: marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says: ""Get a job""

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah: but don't you believe them

Said hey: little boy: you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do
Said hey: old man: how can you stand to think that way?
And did you really think about it before you made the rules?
He said: son

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah: but don't you believe them: yeah

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

Well: they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar: no

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is: it is: it is: it is"
9,Bob Seger,Shakedown,"No matter what you think you pulled
You'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know
You won't get through

It's a given L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you: you

No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view
Awaits downtown

You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down

Shakedown: breakdown: takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown: takedown
You're busted

Let down your guard: honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown: takedown
You're busted (oh: oh: uh)

This is a town where everyone
Is reaching for the top
This is a place where
Second best will never do

It's okay you want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you

Shakedown: breakdown: takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line

Working for her man

We've got each other: and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot!

Whoa-oh: livin' on a prayer

Whoa-oh: livin' on a prayer

13,Crowded House,Don't Dream It's Over,"There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

Hey now: hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now: hey now
When the world comes in
They come: they come
To build a wall between us
We know that they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion: but there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now: hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now: hey now
When the world comes in
They come: they come
To build a wall between us
We know that they won't win

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now: hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now: hey now
When the world comes in
They come: they come
To build a wall between us
You know that they won't win

Don't let them win

Through the storm: we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give: and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied: my body bruised
She's got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

I know

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known

Who would have thought that we would become lovers

Can't help myself: you make me feel so right
I got to: got to: got to tell you: darlin'

Ooh: baby: I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh: baby: I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
I know

Here today: gone tomorrow
It's possible: but I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

He's different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes: head back to the side
Please don't be so mean

14 karat love: you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love diamonds are forever
Top to bottom I love you: I will leave you never

18,Tiffany,I Think We're Alone Now,"Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doin'
'Cause what would they say
If they ever knew?

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me

20,Billy Vera and The Beaters,At This Moment,"What did you think
I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me that you
Have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think
I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well

How could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know I'd never: never hurt you

What do you think
I would give at this moment
If you'd stay
I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on: baby
If I could just hold you

If I: could just hold you
If I: if I could just hold you
Again"
21,Chris De Burgh,The Lady In Red,"I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
Mmm: mmm: mmm: mmm

I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight
I never will forget
The way you look tonight

The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red

I love you"
22,Whitney Houston,Didn't We Almost Have It All,"Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you: I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall: my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall: my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of me and you

We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall: my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we almost have it all"
23,U2,I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,"I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

I have run: I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes: I'm still running

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross and all my shame
All my shame: you know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for"
24,George Michael,I Want Your Sex,"There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't

There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go

I'd really like to try
Oh: I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's natural
It's chemical (Let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (Can we do it?)

It's sensual
But most of all...
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural: sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural: sex is fun
Sex is best when it's... one on one
One on one

I'm not your father
I'm not your brother
Talk to your sister
I am a lover

C-c-c-c-come on

What's your definition of dirty baby
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency

Just remember

I follow you around but you can't see
Too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way

Don't try to run: I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying: you've got to

I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way
To get out of this

Her diary sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed: the cat's in her cradle
Who would've thought
That a boy like me could come to this?

Oh-oh-oh: whoa
Oh: I: I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh-oh-oh: whoa

Oh: I: I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface: I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet
But then blow it again

I've lost and found: it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy: no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy
One too many times

Oh-oh-oh: whoa
Oh: I: I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh: I: I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy: she made it feel right
But now it's over: the moment is gone
I followed my hands: not my head
I know I was wrong

Set me free why don't cha: babe?
Get out of my life why don't cha: babe? (wooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Why don't cha be a man about it
And set me free? (wooh)
Now you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me: hey: abusing me

Get out: get out of my life
And let me sleep at night (wooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on (wooh)"
35,Georgia Satellites,Keep Your Hands To Yourself,"I got a little change in my pocket going ching-a-ling-a-ling
Wanna call you on the telephone: baby: give you a ring
But each time we talk: I get the same old thing
Always: ""No huggee: no kissee until I get a wedding ring""
My honey: my baby: don't put my love upon no shelf
She said: ""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself""

Ooh: baby: baby: baby: why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy: I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said: ""No huggee: no kissee until I get a wedding vow""
My honey: my baby: don't put my love upon no shelf
She said: ""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself""

You see: I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love: started talking about sin
I said: ""Honey: I'll live with you for the rest of my life""
She said: ""No huggee: no kissee until you make me a wife""
My honey: my baby: don't put my love upon no shelf
She said: ""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"""
36,Aretha Franklin and George Michael,I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me),"Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Mmmm: somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did: I escaped: uh-huh
I found my way out of the darkness
Kept my faith
I know you did
Kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me: no no
I knew you were waitin'
I knew you were waiting for me: uh-huh

With an endless desire I-I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Light the bridges on fire: the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No: I don't regret a single moment
No I don't
I know you don't
Looking back: uhh
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh
I know you do
I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me: ahh-ah
I knew you were waiting: ahh-ahah
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny: Ooh boy: Ohh
I know this love we share was meant to be: No-oahh-oh-oh
Knew you were waiting: Woo-Hoo-Ooh-ooh-oooh-wah
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
Oh: I didn't falter
I didn't falter: no
I still believe
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Nothing can stop me: no
No way
Knew you were waiting
No I: knew you were waiting for me
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high-gh
I still believe
Oh: when the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Ha: no it didn't stop me: no
Knew you were waiting: stop me
Knew you were: waiting for me: yeah-ah
I didn't falter
Ahhh: Ohhh yeah
I still believe
Oh-oh: I still believe
It didn't stop me
Oh: you know it didn't stop me: no
No-oh
Knew you were waiting
Some day
Some way
Some where
Some how
For me
I didn't falter
When the valley was low
I still believe
I still believe
I believe: I believe
It didn't stop me
An army couldn't stop me
Knew you were waiting
No way"
37,Janet Jackson,Control,"This is a story about control:
My control
Control of what I say: control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready? I am.
'Cause it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

When I was seventeen: I did what people told me
Did what my father said: and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago

I'm in control: never gonna stop
Control - to get what I want
Control - I got to have a lot
Control - now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love
I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive
I thought it would be easy
But now I know I've got to take...

Control - I got to have a lot
Control - to get what I want
Control - never gonna stop
Control - now I'm all grown up

That's right: I'm on my own:
I'll call my own shots: thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life: my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand
And lead you on this dance (control)
'Cause what I've got is because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world
Just wanna run my life
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take...

Control - I got to have a lot
Control - to get what I want
Control - never gonna stop
Control - now I'm all grown up

Free at last: out here on my own
Now control this
That's right: career moves
I do what's right for me
And me wants to groove
Is that okay?

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control (and I love it: that's right)
Control - now I've got a lot
Control - now I'm all grown up

I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't make me lose it"

Boy versus girl in the World Series of love

Color me taken aback

39,Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram,Somewhere Out There,"Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true"
40,Genesis,Land Of Confusion,"I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now: did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men: too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well: this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh: Superman: where are you now?
Well: everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel: men of power
They're losing control by the hour

This is the time: this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh: when the sun was shining
And the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men: there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well: this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the names we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Stand up and let's start showing (Oh-oh-oh)
Just where our lives are going to"
41,Huey Lewis and The News,Jacob's Ladder,"I met a fan dancer
Down in Southside Birmingham
She was running from a fat man
Selling salvation in his hand

Now he's trying to save me
When I'm doing all right
The best that I can

Just another fallen angel 
Trying to get through the night

Step by step: one by one
Higher and higher 
Step by step: rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

Coming over the airwaves
The man says I'm overdue
Sing along: send some money
Join the chosen few: hey

Mister: I'm not in a hurry
And I don't want to be like you
All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step: one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step: rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step: one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step: rung by rung
Climbing and climbing

Step by step: one by one
Step by step: rung by rung
Step by step
And step by step
Step by step"

You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know: don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him

You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not

No: don't let him worry you so

44,Samantha Fox,Touch Me (I Want Your Body),"Full moon in the city
And the night was young
I was hungry for love
I was hungry for fun

I was hunting you down
And I was the bait
When I saw you there
I didn't mean to hesitate

This is the night

This is the time we've got to get it right

Touch me: touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine

Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy?
Didn't I treat you right?

Made me feel myself

Like a tramp in the night
I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to

Know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much

I hear your voice so
I call your name

Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you

Your love's got me high
I long to get by

At your call I hear harps
And angels sing

I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living

I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

We can sing songs of yesterday

Nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
But no-one listening

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen: listen to me
Oh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh I know you're going
But I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons for being alone
When I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen: listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else

48,Janet Jackson,Let's Wait Awhile,"There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow

When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile before we go too far

Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together 
We made our very first promise
To love: to share and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile: our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love will be greater

You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you

Let's wait awhile: before it's too late
You know: you can't rush love
Let's just take our time
Love's so good - sure I'll love will be there
Slow it down

I promise: I'll be worth the wait."

'Cause I can tell what's going on

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits: I watch them on TV
I'm working out most every day and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me: but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy: I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out: you see it every day
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway: it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it: an idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

How close to you that I wanna be

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on
No: I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so strong
Do you believe a love could pass you by
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one: you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on (Can't go on)
No: I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

I can't go on (I can't go on)
No: I can't go on

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No: I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on
Without somebody: and if I'm on my own

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No: I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No: I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on: you'll never be alone tonight

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No: I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around: if you could say you love me"

Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

I think it's 'cause I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

They only hit until you cry
After that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
Just don't argue anymore
Just don't argue anymore

Yes: I think I'm okay
I walked into the door again
If you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway

I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken: nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am

Even if you don't go all the way: I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats: it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town: oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No: it don't mean nothing
These games that people play

No: it don't mean nothing
No victim: no crime
No: it don't mean nothing

Whoa yeah

The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says: ""I love your work: babe: but you're just not what we're looking for.""
It's never what: but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow: oh

Take a good look around and you'll find
People trying to mess with your mind

But it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No: it don't mean nothing
These games that people play

No: it don't mean nothing
No victim: no crime
No: it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line

Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
Party is never over
The stars are always shining: doesn't matter if it's day or night

The producer says: ""Let me change a line or two.""
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you wanna scream: but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living: there ain't no such thing as pride: oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing

No: it don't mean nothing

No: it don't mean nothing
No victim: no crime

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone: I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday: not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea: he called to me
Te dijo 'te amo'
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces: no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy: and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday: not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free

In France: a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen year old boys and their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called 'The Disciples'
High on crack and totin' a machine gun

Time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
A sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And yet we're sending people to the moon
In September: my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse: it's June: unh

When a rocket ship explodes and everybody still wants to fly
But some say a man ain't happy unless a man truly dies
Oh why?

Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn?

Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend

Did you think I would stand here and lie
While our moment was passing us by
Oh: while I am here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes: I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes: I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around: around: around
Turn it around: around: around
Turn it around

Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind
While I bide my time

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes: I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

About the two of us from different worlds
I love you so much that it hurts inside
Are you listening
Please listen to me girl

Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside

I hear you on the telephone
With god knows who
Spilling out your heart for free
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
Girls that someone should be me

So many times I've tried to tell you
You just turn away
My life is changing so fast now
Leaves me lonely and afraid
Don't be afraid: no

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
Can't we try just a little more passion

I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside
Don't let our love fade away
No matter what people say
I need you more and more each day

65,Bruce Hornsby and The Range,Mandolin Rain,"The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you've got till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh: listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh: listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance
Listenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air until they play the last song
I'll do my time
Oh: keeping you off my mind but there's moments
That I find: I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Ah: listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh: listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Runnin' down by the lakeshore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again: whoa again

The boat's steaming in
Oh: I watch the side wheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
Oh: I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Ah: listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh: listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
As she turns to go
Listen to the...listen to the mandolin rain

Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Listen to the mandolin rain"

Because tonight: tonight: tonight - oh

69,Glass Tiger,Someday,"When I come home you telephone
To say you're waiting for me
I ask you why - I hear you cry
But you're still waiting for me

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
To cry over me
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Now I'm alone: you telephone
To tell me you don't need me
I ask you why: you tell me lies
And say the truth would hurt me

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
To cry over me
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Oh: oh... someday

Down in the street where lovers meet
That's where I'm waiting for you
In the streets where lovers meet
I'm still waiting for you

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
And then you'll cry over me (cry over me)
Someday I'll be losing this fear

Someday you'll be shedding your tears
And then you'll cry over me (cry over me)
Someday I'll be losing this fear"
70,ABC,When Smokey Sings,"Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes: the sharpest suits
In miracles made real

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right: makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings: I hear violins
When Smokey sings: I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings: he sings

Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right: makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings: I hear violins
When Smokey sings: I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings: he sings

(Would it be true to say)

Luther croons
Sly's the original originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare
When Smokey sings

When Smokey sings: I hear violins
When Smokey sings: I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When Smokey sings
Smokey sings
Smokey sings"

You were all that I anticipated
I wanted you: every part
But I knew love would be complicated

I began to touch but you wouldn't let it
It never seemed to be the right time
I started to give up: down to the limit
And then you changed your mind: oh

And we begin to rock steady: rockin' till the break of dawn
Rock steady: steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady: rockin' till the break of dawn

I should have known: it was in your eyes
That you were gettin' tired of waiting

Wanted: dead or alive

With a snow-white pillow for my big: fat head
And my heaven will be a big heaven

If you hold me
I will let you into my dreams

We must live while we can
And we drink our cup of laughter

The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

Oh: I've been sad
And have walked bitter streets alone
And come morning
There's a good wind to blow me home

So time be a river rolling into nowhere
I will live while I can
I will have my ever after

The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

We go so fast: why don't we make it last
Life is glowing inside you and me
Please take my hand: here where I stand
Wont you come out and dance with me
Come see: with me: come see

And lovers try
'Til they get the best of the night
And come morning
They are tangled up in the light

So time be a river rolling into nowhere
They love while they can
And they think about the night so sweet

The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be"

78,Survivor,Is This Love,"I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end

Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring

I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me 
It's not just a physical rush

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love

So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough

Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart

Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other 
If the moment is right

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love

I've tread those mean streets
Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch: no feeling 
Just another one night stand

I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayers

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love

Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love"

But roses do die

You gave me some candy
It melted

I have simple taste

I just want a token that can't go to waste - Diamonds.

Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Something so strong
Something so strong

Something: something so strong"
84,Bryan Adams,Heat Of The Night,"I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night"

86,Bruce Springsteen,Brilliant Disguise,"I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered: baby
Just as you turn away

I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I want to read your mind to know
Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you: baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow

Well: I've tried so hard baby
But I just can't see
Oh: what a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you: baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me: baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh: when out go the lights

I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now: you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand

Oh: we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore our future was bright
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe: baby: the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me: baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of"

I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again

I can't hide it: no
I can't fight it: oh
It's so hard to live without the love
She gave to me

Doesn't she know it?

Can't I make her realize that she
Really needs me again?

There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)

She brightens up my everyday
Makes me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again

88,Heart,Who Will You Run Too,
89,Bruce Willis,Respect Yourself,"If you disrespect everybody
That you run into
How in the world do you think
Anybody 'sposed to respect you

If you don't give a heck about
The man with a bible in his hand
Just get out the way and
Let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of gentleman
That wants everything their way
Take the sheet off your face: boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself

If you're walking around thinking
That the world owes you something
'Cause you're here
You're going out the world backwards
Like you did when you first came here

Keep talking about the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand over your mouth
When you cough
That'll help the solution

You cuss around women folk
You don't even know their name
Then you're dumb enough to think
That it makes you a big ol' man

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself"

Cross my broken heart: boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

I know you think I'm not
Your picture-perfect jewel
Who'll never break apart
When everything was cool

I needed to explore
And open up the door

It's easy to get burned

I learned my lesson well
It's you I need to tell
This time I'm all for you

I need for you to trust me
To give you all my best
I'll prove just what your love means
Just put me to the test

Don't need to go away
I'm still in love with you

91,Kool and The Gang,Victory,"People get ready
It's time to show what you got

92,Pretenders,Don't Get Me Wrong,"Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Don't get me wrong
If you say hello and I take a ride
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
Is playing havoc with the tide
Don't get me wrong

Don't get me wrong
If I'm acting so distracted
I'm thinking about the fireworks
That go off when you smile

Don't get me wrong
If I split like light refracted
I'm only off to wander
Across a moonlit mile

Once in a while
Two people meet
Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street

Suddenly: thunder
Showers everywhere
Who can explain the thunder and rain?
But there's something in the air

Don't get me wrong
If I come and go like fashion
I might be great tomorrow
But hopeless yesterday

Don't get me wrong
If I fall in the mode of fashion
It might be unbelievable
But let's not say so long
It might just be fantastic
Don't get me wrong"
93,Huey Lewis and The News,Doing It All For My Baby,"Early in the morning: I'm still in bed
She comes to me with sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses: ""Hello sleepyhead.""
Gets me moving in the right direction

I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Later in the evening: it's been a busy day
She lays her head upon my weary shoulder
Listen to her laughing: snuggle up and say
Now I'm with you baby: the loneliness is over

I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
Doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me

94,Breakfast Club,Right On Track,"Gonna make a move that knocks you over
Watch this turn this one's gonna put you away
But I'm doing my very best dancing: yeah

Hey: I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)

(Right on track) Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

How far away can you go and still dancing with me?
Would you mind staying in the vicinity
I've not been faring badly
But I would gladly take you back!

(Right on track: ooohooohooohooo
Get you back
Right on track)

There must be some kind of bad connection
Because this music does not sound the way it did
I got to get up and back 'cause I've been off track
And that may be just why you disappeared

But now I've got you in the corner of my eye
And I've got one more move I can try

Hey: I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track: is that gonna get you back?

You are so lovely 
With you standing there
I'm so aware 
Of how much I care for you

You are more than now 
You are for always 
I can see in you 
My dreams come true 
Don't you ever go away 

You make me feel like 
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you 
I only want to say
I love you 

Ballerina Girl 
The joy you bring me 
Every day and night 
Holding you tight 
How I've waited for your love

Sometimes I've wondered 
If you'd ever come my way 
Now that I've finally found you 
This is where my heart will stay 

I'm never gonna break your heart
Never will we drift apart 
'Cause all I wanna do 
Is share my whole life with you 

'Cause you make me feel like 
There's nothing I can't do 
I guess I finally realized 
There's nothing else like loving you

You are so lovely 
I can see in you 
My dreams come true 
Don't you ever go away

96,Kenny Loggins,Meet Me Half Way,"In a lifetime
Made of memories
I believe
In destiny
Every moment returns again in time
When I've got the future on my mind
Know that you'll be the only one

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Out where the world belongs
To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life.

In a lifetime
There is only love
Reaching for the lonely one
We are stronger when we are given love
When we put emotions on the line
Know that we are the timeless ones

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Out where the world belongs
To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life."

Catch my breath: close my eyes
Don't believe a word
Things she said: overheard
Something wrong inside

Hits you in a minute: ooh
Then you know you're in it: ahh

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before
I've been in love before

Just one touch: just one look
A dangerous dance
One small word can make me feel
Like running away

You can't say you're in it: no
Until you reach the limit

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before
I've been in love before

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before
I've been in love before

The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love
I've been in love before"
