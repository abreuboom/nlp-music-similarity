1,Simon and Garfunkel,Bridge Over Troubled Water,"When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side: whoa
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part: oh
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on: silvergirl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine: oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind!"
2,Carpenters,(They Long To Be) Close To You,"Why do birds suddenly appear everytime you are near?
Just like me: they long to be close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky everytime you walk by?
Just like me: they long to be close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dreams come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (all around)
Just like me: they long to be close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dreams come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (all around)
Just like me: they long to be close to you
Just like me: (Just like me) they long to be close to you

4,B.J. Thomas,Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,"Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head: they keep falling

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head: they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause: I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me: 'cause:
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me"
5,Edwin Starr,War,"War: huh: yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: uh-huh: uh-huh

War: huh: yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: say it again: y'all

War: huh: good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: listen to me

Oh war: I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said: war: huh: good god: y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: say it again

War: huh: whoa-oh-whoa-oh: Lord
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: listen to me

War: it ain't nothing but a heartbreak
War: friend only to the undertaker

Oh: war: is an enemy to all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest within the younger generation
Induction then destruction: who wants to die?

Oh: war: huh: good god: y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: say it: say it: say it

War: huh: uh-huh: yeah: uh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: listen to me

War: it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War: it got one friend: that's the undertaker

Oh: war has shattered many a young man's dreams
Made him disabled: bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to spend fighting wars these days
War can't give life: it can only take it away

Oh: war: huh: good god: y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: say it again

War: huh: whoa-oh-whoa-oh: Lord
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing: listen to me

War: it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War: friend only to the undertaker

Peace: love and understanding: tell me
Is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But lord knows there's got to be a better way

Oh: war: huh: good god: y'all
What is it good for?
You tell me: (nothing) say it: say it: say it: say it

War: huh: good god: yeah: huh
What is it good for?
Stand up and shout it (nothing)"
6,Diana Ross,Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"Ah: ah: ah
Ooh: ooh
Ah: ah: ah
Ooh: ooh

If you need me: call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry

You see: my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs
The thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please: my darling
Let it be me

Ah: ah: ah
Ooh: ooh

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

(No wind) No wind
(No rain) No rain
(Or winter's cold Can stop me baby) Ooh baby
(Baby) Baby
(If you're my goal) Oh
(No wind) No wind
(No rain) No rain
(Can stop me baby) If you are my goal

Ah: ah: ah
Ooh: ooh

I know: I know you must follow the sun
Where ever it leads
But remember: if you should fall short of your desires
Remember life's holds to you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you the day I set you free

(Ain't no mountain high enough) Oh
(Ain't no valley low enough) Ooh
(Ain't no river wide enough) Ooh
To keep me from you

(Ain't no mountain high enough) Ow
(Ain't no valley low enough) Say it again
(Ain't no river wide enough) Hey
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me: keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (no)
Nothing can keep me: keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough (oh)
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough (yeah yeah)
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
(Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough)
Nothing can keep me: keep me from you
(Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you)

Nothing in this world
(Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough)
Nothing in this world to keep me from you
(Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you)"

9,Beatles,Let It Be,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

(Ooh) Let it be: let it be
A-let it be: let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be: let it be
Let it be: let it be
Yeah: there will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be: let it be

Whisper words of wisdom

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Yeah: let it be: let it be
Let it be: yeah: let it be
Oh: there will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be: let it be

10,Freda Payne,Band Of Gold,"Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

You took me from the shelter of my mother
I had never known or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness: filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Ohh

Don't you know that I wait 
In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness: filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold"
11,Three Dog Night,Mama Told Me (Not To Come),"Want some whiskey in your water?
Sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions they're askin' me?
This is the craziest party that could ever be
Don't turn on the lights 'cause I don't wanna see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
""That ain't the way to have fun: no""

Open up the window: let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin' from the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scare me half to death
Open up the window: sucker: let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
""That ain't the way to have fun: son""
""That ain't the way to have fun: son""

The radio is blastin': someone's knockin' at the door
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend - she's passed out on the floor
I seen so many things I ain't never seen before
Don't know what it is - I don't wanna see no more

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
She said: ""That ain't the way to have fun: son""
""That ain't the way to have fun: no""

""That ain't the way to have fun: no""
""That ain't the way to have fun: son""
""That ain't the way to have fun: no""
""That ain't the way to have fun: son""

""That ain't the way to have fun: no""
""That ain't the way to have fun: son""
""That ain't the way to have fun: no""
""That ain't the way to have fun: son"""
12,Ray Stevens,Everything Is Beautiful,"Jesus loves the little children
All the children of the world
Pretty yellow black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world

Everything is beautiful
In its own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day

And everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

There is none so blind
As he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thoughts be free

For every hour that passes by
You know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that people lies
In the eyes of the beholder

And everything is beautiful
In its own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day: ah sing it children

And everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care about the length of his hair
Of the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within

We're gonna get old again now
Everything is gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to the calm good side my friend
And spittle in out in your mind

And everything is beautiful
In its own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day: ah sing it children

And everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way: one more time

Everything is beautiful
In its own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day"
13,Bread,Make It With You,"Hey: have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows
But: baby: here goes

Dreams: they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wondering what this song is leading to
I want to make it with you
I really think that we could make it: girl

Though you don't know me well
In every little thing only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
Then we'll see it through

Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it: girl

Baby: you know that
Dreams: they're for those who sleep
Life: it's for us to keep
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through
I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we could make it: girl"
14,Vanity Fare,Hitchin' A Ride,"A thumb goes up: a car goes by
It's nearly 1 AM and here am I
Hitchin' a ride: hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home by the mornin' light

16,Jackson 5,The Love You Save,"Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it
Stop: stop: stop: you'd better save it

When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit

When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling: take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling: look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down 
As soon as they succeed

They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you 
They'll turn your name to dirt: oh

Isaac said he kissed you 
Beneath the apple tree 
When Benjie held your hand he felt 
Electricity

When Alexander called you 
He said he rang your chimes
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your times

Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling: take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling: look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

S is for ""Save it"" 
T is for ""Take it slow"" 
O is for ""Oh: no!"" 
P is for ""Please: please: don't go!"" 

The love you save may be your own
Some day you may be all alone
Stop it
Save it: girl
Baby! Ooooh

You'd better stop! the love you save may be your own
Please: please
Or some day: some day baby: you'll be all alone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed
Ahh

Stop! The love you save may be your own: baby
You'd better stop it: stop it: stop it girl
Or someday you'll be all alone

The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name: turn your name to dirt
Stop! The love you save may be your own!

Some day baby you'll be all alone

Wait a while
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed"

18,Dawn,Candida,"The stars won't come out 
If they know that you're about
'Cause they couldn't match the glow of your eyes
And: oh: who am I
Just an ordinary guy
Trying hard to win me first prize

Oh: Candida
We could make it together
The further from here: girl: the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Hmm: Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise life will be sweeter
And it said so in my dreams

The future is bright
The gypsy told me so last night
Said she saw our children playing in the sunshine
And there was you and I 
In a house: baby: no lie
And all these things were yours and they were mine

Whoa my: Candida
We could make it together
The further from here: girl: the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Hmm: Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise life will be sweeter
And it said so in my dreams

And: oh: who am I
Just an ordinary guy
You know: I'm trying hard to win me first prize

Oh my: Candida
We could make it together
The further from here: girl: the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Whoa my: Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise that life will be sweeter
And it said so in my dreams"
19,Sly and The Family Stone,Thank You (Fallettin Me Be Mice Elf Again),
20,Eric Burdon and War,Spill The Wine,"I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie
But there I was
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones: tall ones: short ones: brown ones
Black ones: round ones: big ones: crazy ones
Out of the middle: came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said...

Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl

I thought to myself: what could that mean?
Am I going crazy: or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute...
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one: more time

Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared: but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it: she said

Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl
Spill the wine: take that pearl

It's on girl: all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine: let me feel: let me feel hot: yeah! yeah!
Spill the wine: spill the wine: spill the wine: spill the wine

Run: run: run: but you just can't hide

An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on: brother: rap on

Well: the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
Segregation: determination: demonstration: integration: aggravation: humiliation
Obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today: hey

The sales of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky
The cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on

Evolution: revolution: gun control: sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say: ""More taxes will solve everything:""
And the band played on

So: round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows

Oh: Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today: hey

Fear in the air: tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live
Is on an Indian reservation
The band played on

Eve of destruction: tax deduction
City inspectors: bill collectors: mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand: suicide: too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting: ""End the war!""
And the band played on

35,Clarence Carter,Patches,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See: education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad

The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

Oh: life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:

""Patches: I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son: it's all left up to you""

Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule

So every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave: just run away from home

But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:

""Patches: I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know: mama knew what I was going through

'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See: I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me

Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord: give him strength to make another day""

Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows: people: I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':

""Patches: I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son: it's all left up to you""

Oh: I could still hear papa's voice sayin':

""Patches: I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

I could still hear papa when he's saying:

""Patches: I'm depending on you: son
To pull the family through
My son: it's all left up to you"""

It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life: and you just got to play the game

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take my guitar
To pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I feel fine: I

The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring

When I was young: my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me: that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could: you know that I would fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So: little snowbird: take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could: you know that I would fly away with you

Yeah: if I could: you know that I would fly

And say: don't cry
I'll kiss your tears away

Hey lonely girl

Can kiss your lips
And make your heart stand still
But once you're in my arms you'll see
No one can kiss 
Your lips the way I will
The way I will

Rap: rap: rap: you know what he's after

So he starts his rappin'
Hoping something will happen
He'll say he needs you
A companion: a girl he can talk to
He's made up his mind
He needs someone to sock it to

Rap-a-rap-a-rap: they call him the rapper

So he makes a suggestion
Come up to my place
For some coffee: or tea: or me

With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy: he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy: he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

It's a long: long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share?
And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all

When everything I do is wrong
You give me love and consolation
You give me hope to carry on

And you're always there
To lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder: the wonder of you

And when you smile: the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your love to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything

I guess I'll never know
The reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder: the wonder of you

The reason why
You love me as you do

Better get: while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon's turn to wood

Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for: what you say

Come on the risin' wind

Catch a ride to the end of the highway

Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you

I'm not saying I want to change you
I don't want to rearrange you

If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?

From the very first moment I saw you
It's been a different world
From the very first moment I saw you
It's been such a different world

I seem to be a little bit stronger
Each moment seems just a little 
Little bit longer
The missing links and little kinks
Have never been found and uncurled

But you're still the same
You're like a frozen flame
Well it sure seems a shame
You let me make love to you
But you won't let me touch you

When I leave you I'm going someplace
That I've never been before
When I leave you I'm going someplace
That I've never been before
Reach out and touch me
Why don't you reach out and touch me

If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?"
75,B.J. Thomas,I Just Can't Help Believing,"I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes

And I just can't help believing
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sigh

This time the girl is gonna stay 
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day

I just can't help believing
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove

And I just can't help believing
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love

This time the girl is gonna stay (This time the girl is gonna stay)
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day

For more than just a day

77,Bobbi Martin,For The Love Of Him,"When he opens the door says ""I'm home""
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been
For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be times when he won't say a word
And you wonder if it's something you said
The gentle touch of your hand
Tell him you understand
For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out be there
Show him that someone cares.

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run: let him fall: let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart.

For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can"

Buy her dresses that shine

92,Tom Jones,Without Love (There Is Nothing),"I awakened this morning: I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone: oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare

Without love I've had nothing at all
Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all

Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing: oh that she would not give: oh no
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all"
93,Pacific Gas and Electric,Are You Ready?,
94,"Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young",Woodstock,"Well: I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him: ""tell me: where are you going?""
This he told me

Said: ""I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free""

We are stardust: we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Well: then can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel myself a cog 
In somethin' turning

And maybe it's the time of year
Yes: and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning

We are stardust: we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

We are stardust: we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust: we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves 
Back to the garden"
95,Dionne Warwick,I'll Never Fall In Love Again,"What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do: he'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again

Don't tell me what's it all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains: those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get a life of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
No: no: I'll never fall in love again

I'm out of those chains: those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again"
96,New Seekers,Look What They've Done To My Song Ma,
97,Joe South,Walk A Mile In My Shoes,"If I could be you 
And you could be me 
For just one hour
If we could find a way 
To get inside 
Each other's mind: mmm
If you could see you
Through your eyes 
Instead of your ego
I believe you'd be 
Surprised to see 
That you'd been blind: mmm

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey: before you abuse: criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now your whole world 
You see around you 
Is just a reflection
And the law of karma
Says you're gonna reap 
Just what you sow: yes you will
So unless 
You've lived a life of 
Total perfection
You'd better be careful 
Of every stone 
That you should throw: yeah

And yet we spend the day 
Throwing stones 
At one another
'Cause I don't think
Or wear my hair 
The same way you do: mmm
Well I may be 
Common people 
But I'm your brother
And when you strike out 
And try to hurt me 
It's a-hurtin' you: lord have mercy

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey: before you abuse: criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

There are people 
On reservations 
And out in the ghettos
And brother there 
But for the grace of God 
Go you and I: yeah: yeah
If I only 
Had the wings 
Of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly 
To the top of the mountain
And then I'd cry

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey: before you abuse: criticize and accuse
Better walk a mile in my shoes

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Uh: before you abuse: criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes: yeah

Walk a mile in my shoes"
98,B.B. King,The Thrill Is Gone,"The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone: baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong: baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me: yeah
The thrill is gone: baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
Oh: the thrill is gone
Baby: it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all: baby
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free: free now: baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh: I'm free: free: free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well"
99,Glen Campbell,It's Only Make Believe,"People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes: my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes: my dreams come true
My life: I'd give for you
My heart: a wedding ring
My all: my everything

My heart: I can't control
You rule my very soul
My plans: my hopes: my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes: my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
Just how much I love you so
My only prayer will be
That someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe"
100,Aretha Franklin,Call Me,"I love you: and I love you and I love you too
Baby will you call me the moment you get there
Hey baby: I love you: and I love you: and I love you too
Baby will you call me the moment you get there yeah
Yeah: baby: my dearest: my dearest of all darlings
I know: I know: I know: I know we've got the part
Baby: baby: baby: baby: baby
It really don't hurt me that bad yeah
Because you are taking me with you
And I'm keeping you right here in my arms

It's all because I love you: I love you: and I love you: I love you too
Baby will you call me the moment you get there
Baby will you do that: will you do that for me now
Oh call me: call me now: call me the minute: second that you get there
'Cause I love you:..."
