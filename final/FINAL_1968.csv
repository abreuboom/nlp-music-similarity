1,Beatles,Hey Jude,"Hey Jude: don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude: don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude: refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder

For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Na na na na na na na na na

Hey Jude: don't let me down
You have found her: now go and get her (so let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude: begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with

And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude: you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Na na na na na na na na na yeah

Hey Jude: don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin (Whoa!)
Then you begin (Fucking hell) to make it better
Better: better: better: better: better!

3,Bobby Goldsboro,Honey,"See the tree: how big it's grown
But friend: it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it: was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late 'cause I would know
That she'd been sittin there an' cryin'
Over some sad and silly late: late show

And Honey: I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad: but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing: she went away

And Honey: I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived: and Honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes over head
And cries down on the flower bed that Honey loved

And see the tree: how big it's grown
But friend: it hasn't been too long: it wasn't big
And I laughed at her: she got mad
The first day that she planted it: was just a twig"
4,Otis Redding,(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay,"Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again: yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away: ooh
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
Look like nothing's gonna come my way

So: I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away: ooh
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same: listen

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone: listen
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home: now

I'm just gon' sit at the dock of a bay
Watching the tide roll away: ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time"
5,Rascals,People Got To Be Free,"All the world over: so easy to see
People everywhere just wanna be free
Listen: please listen: that's the way it should be
There's peace in the valley: people got to be free

You should see what a lovely: lovely world this'd be
Everyone learned to live together: ah hah
Seems to me such an itty bitty thing should be
Why can't you and me learn to love one another?

All the world over: so easy to see
People everywhere just wanna be free (wanna be free)
I can't understand it: so simple to me
People everywhere just got to be free

If there's a man who is down and needs a helpin' hand
All it takes is you to understand and to pull him through: ah hah
Seems to me we got to solve it individually: ah ah
And I'll do unto you what you do to me
Said: no

Shout it from the mountain on out to the sea
No two ways about it: people have to be free (they gotta be free)
Ask me my opinion: my opinion will be
Natural situation for a man to be free
Get right on board now: huh: huh

Oh: what a feelin's just come over me
Love can move a mountain: make a blind man see
Everybody sing it now come on let's go see
Peace in the valley now: we all can be free

See that train over there?
Now that's the train of freedom
It's about to 'rrive any minute: now
You know it's been'a long: long overdue
Look out 'cause it's a'comin' right on through
Ha: ha: yeah"

11,Jeannie C. Riley,Harper Valley P.T.A.,"I want to tell you all the story bout the Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well: her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said: ""Mom: I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well: the note said: ""Mrs. Johnson: you're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the Secretary: Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said: ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well: there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker: can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't Widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well: Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother: I'm not fit
Well: this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites!""

No: I wouldn't put you on because it really did: it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A."
12,O.C. Smith,Little Green Apples,"And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says: ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school... goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says: ""How ya feelin': hon?""
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun

And if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland: and Mother Goose: no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

And if that ain't lovin' me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs: autumn leaves and BB guns

God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis"

15,Gary Puckett and The Union Gap,Young Girl,"Young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run: girl
You're much too young: girl

With all the charms of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
You led me to believe you're old enough
To give me Love
And now it hurts to know the truth

Whoa: oh: oh: young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run: girl
You're much too young: girl

Beneath your perfume and make-up
You're just a baby in disguise
And though you know that it's wrong to be
Alone with me
That come on look is in your eyes

Whoa: oh: oh: young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run: girl
You're much too young: girl

So hurry home to your mama
I'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out of here before I have the time
To change my mind
'Cause I'm afraid we'll go too far

Whoa: oh: oh: young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run: girl
You're much too young: girl

16,Box Tops,Cry Like A Baby,"When I think about the good love you gave me:
I cry like a baby.
Living without you is driving me crazy:
I cry like a baby.
Well: I know now that you're not a play thing:
Not a toy: or a puppet on a string.

As I look back on a love so sweet now:
I cry like a baby.
Every road is a lonely street:
I cry like a baby.
I know now that you're not a play thing:
Not a toy: or a puppet on a string.

Today we passed on a street:
And you just walked on by.
My heart just fell to my feet:
And once again I began to cry.

When I think about the good love you gave me:
I cry like a baby.
Living without you is driving me crazy:
I cry like a baby.

I know now that you're not a play thing:
I cry like a baby.
As I look back on a love so sweet now:
I cry like a baby.
Every road is a lonely street:
I cry like a baby.
My heart just fell to my feet: you know 
I cried like a baby.
You left the water running now: 
I cried like a baby."

In those eyes: I see reflected
A hurt: scorned: rejected

Love child: never meant to be
Love child: born in poverty
Love child: never meant to be
Love child: take a look at me

Started my life in an old: cold: rundown tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left: he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating

Love child: always second best (Wait: wait: won't you wait now: hold on)
Love child: different from the rest

(Hold on: hold on: just a little bit longer) Mmm: baby

I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love child: love child: never quite as good (Wait: wait: won't you wait now: hold on)

28,Merrilee Rush,Angel Of The Morning,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no reason to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning: angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me: baby
Just call me angel of the morning: angel
Then slowly turn away from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well: it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning: angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me: baby
Just call me angel of the morning: angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay
With me (me)
Through the tears
Of the day
Of the years
Baby: baby

Just call me angel of the morning: angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me: baby
Just call me angel of the morning: angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me: baby"
29,Georgie Fame,The Ballad Of Bonnie And Clyde,"Bonnie and Clyde were pretty looking people
But I can tell you people
They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store
And hightailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down

Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business
""Reach for the sky"" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag
Now one brave man: he tried to take 'em alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home.

Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dying
But deep inside 'em they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lying
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun
And the morning dew

Acting upon reliable information
A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them

Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally together
They died"
30,Mary Hopkin,Those Were The Days,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
Think of all the great things we would do

Those were the days: my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
Oh: yes: those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days
Oh: yes: those were the days

Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days: oh yes: those were the days"
31,Steppenwolf,Born To Be Wild,"Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Explode into space

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under

Yeah darling go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born: born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never want to die

Born to be wild

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway

As we followed in the dance

'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds: like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers
By the trees

Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have the recipe again

For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh: after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

I felt I truly loved
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad: I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

I took her home to mama
Mama wanted to see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
And then she called me to her side

She said: ""Son: take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing""

But I didn't listen to mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait to have a little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both 
And then he called me to his side

He said: ""Son: take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
You better take time to know her
Please: please don't rush into this thing""

When it look like every thing was gonna turn out all right
And then I came home a little early one night
And there she was kissin' on another man

Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand
And said son: take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing

Take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her"

I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
So let's stay together

I've got some memories to look back on
Though they help when you phone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of your being there: oh

Said: &#x201C;Come and walk with me: come and walk one more mile
Now for once in your life you're alone
But you ain't got a dime: there's no time for the phone&#x201D;

I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on: hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on: hold on

I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart: won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go

I've just go to get a message to you
Hold on: hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on: hold on

Well I laughed: but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying: but deep down inside
Well I did it to him: now it's my turn to die

I've just got to get a message to you
Hold on: hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on: hold on

I've just got to get a message to her
Hold on: hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on"
60,Beatles,Lady Madonna,"Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet?

Who finds the money
When you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet"

Unenlightened shadows cast
Down through all eternity

Yes: yes: right between my sound machine
On a cloud of sound: I drift in the night

Goes far: flies near
To the stars away from here

Look inside: girl

And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well: someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around
A lousy candle's all I found

I could see: that girl was no good for me
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free

I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door

She stood there laughing
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My: my: my: Delilah

And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did: but you did

If you took your love to somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death

And I thank you
You didn't have to hold me but you did

You pull out your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you

Without your love baby: it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out

69,Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66,The Fool On The Hill,"Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin 
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on his way his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices 
Talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill"
70,Eric Burdon and The Animals,Sky Pilot,"He blesses the boys as they stand in line
The smell of gun grease and the bayonets they shine
He's there to help them all that he can
To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man
Sky pilot... sky pilot
How high can you fly
You'll never: never: never reach the sky

He smiles at the young soldiers
Tells them it's all right
He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight
Soon there'll be blood and many will die
Mothers and fathers back home they will cry
Sky pilot... sky pilot
How high can you fly
You'll never: never: never reach the sky

He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile
The order is given
They move down the line
But he's still behind and he'll meditate
But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate
As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good: with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage in the words that he said
Sky pilot... sky pilot
How high can you fly

You'll never: never: never reach the sky
You're soldiers of God you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell

In the morning they return
With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words
""Thou shalt not kill""
Sky pilot... sky pilot
How high can you fly
You never: never: never reach the sky"

Or a honey-loving mama bear
Just take a left at the bridge
Go down to Quakertown Ridge
And in a minute you're there (in a minute you're there)

Reliving precious moments we knew

So many days have gone by
Still I'm so lonely and I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

Within the prison walls of my mind
There's still apart of you left behind
And though it hurts I'll get by
Without your loving yet I guess this just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

And I guess there's just no getting over you

75,Stevie Wonder,Shoo-Bee-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day,
76,Irish Rovers,The Unicorn,"A long time ago when the earth was green:
And there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen:
They'd run around free while the earth was being born:
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn.

There was green alligators and long necked geese:
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees:
Some cats and rats and elephants: but sure as you're born:
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain:
And He says ""Stand back: I'm going to make it rain.""
He says ""Hey brother Noah: I'll tell you what to do:
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...

Green alligators and long necked geese:
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees:
Some cats and rats and elephants: but sure as you're born:
Don't you forget My Unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call:
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin'.
He marched in the animals two by two:
And he called out as they went through: ""Hey Lord: I got your...""

Green alligators and long necked geese:
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees:
Some cats and rats and elephants: but Lord I'm so forlorn:
I just can't see no Unicorn.""

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain:
Them Unicorns were hiding: playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring:
Oh them silly Unicorns.

There was green alligators and long necked geese:
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees:
Noah cried ""Close the door: cause the rain is pouring:
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn.""

The ark started movin: it drifted with the tide.
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried:
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away:
And that's why you never seen a Unicorn... to this very day.

You'll see green alligators and long necked geese:
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees:
Some cats and rats and elephants: but sure as you're born:
You're never gonna see no Unicorn."

Dawn-light smiles on you: leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place
Where the sun never shines
Wait in this place
Where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket: restless diesels: goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out: felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue
When the trains come back
Lie with you
Where the shadows run from themselves

At the party: she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing: goodbye windows: tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place
With the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark
Where the shadows run from themselves"

Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week: maybe two
They'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years: how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They've got a lot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

Oh: L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week: maybe two
They'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years: how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Oh: do you know the way to San Jose?
Hmmmm: can't wait to get back to San Jose"

91,Manfred Mann,The Mighty Quinn,"Everybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments: others are jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair: every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come all without: come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without: come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do: I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste it ain't my cup of meat
Everybody's beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here all the pigeons gonna run to him

Come all without: come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without: come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do: I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste ain't my cup of meat
Nobody can get no sleep: there's someone on everyone's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna want to doze

Come all without: come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without: come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn"

Darling I promise you this

Sealed with a kiss

I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there
I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
