1,Lulu,To Sir With Love,"Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy: but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir: with love

The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong: that's a lot to learn
What: what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir: with love"
2,Box Tops,The Letter,"Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone: I'm-a goin' home
My baby: just-a wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone: I'm-a goin' home
My baby: just-a wrote me a letter

Well: she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen: mister: can't you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway: yeah!

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone: I'm-a goin' home
My baby: just-a wrote me a letter

Well: she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen: mister: can't you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway: yeah!

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone: I'm-a goin' home
My baby: just-a wrote me a letter

My baby: just-a wrote me a letter"
3,Bobby Gentry,Ode To Billie Joe,"It was the third of June: another sleepy: dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door: ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet.""
And then she said: ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge.
Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
""Well: Billie Joe never had a lick of sense. Pass the biscuits: please.
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow.""
And Mama said it was a shame about Billie Joe: anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
He put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie. You know: it don't seem right.
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge.
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

Mama said to me: ""Child: what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite.
That nice young preacher: Brother Taylor: dropped by today.
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday. Oh: by the way:
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge.
And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson: they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round: Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me: I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
4,Association,Windy,"Who's peeking out from under a stairway
Calling a name that's lighter than air?
Who's bending down to give me a rainbow?
Everyone knows it's Windy

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy

And Windy has stormy eyes
That flash at the sound of lies
And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)

And Windy has stormy eyes
That flash at the sound of lies
And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smiling at everybody she sees?
Who's reaching out to capture a moment?
Everyone knows it's Windy"
5,Monkees,I'm A Believer,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face: now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer: I couldn't leave her if I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got

What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face: now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer: I couldn't leave her if I tried: ah

Oh: love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Then I saw her face: now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
Oh: I'm a believer: I couldn't leave her if I tried

Yes: I saw her face: now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Said: I'm a believer: yeah
Said: I'm a believer: yeah (I'm a believer)
Said: I'm a believer: yeah (I'm a believer)"

7,Nancy Sinatra and Frank Sinatra,Somethin' Stupid,"I know I stand in line until you think
You have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lines you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice everyday to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and on the nights so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying
Something stupid like I love you"
8,Turtles,Happy Together,"Imagine me and you: I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right
To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up: invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me: baby: the skies will be blue for all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me: baby: the skies will be blue for all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

Ba: ba-ba: ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba
Ba: ba-ba: ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

So happy together
How is the weather?
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
So happy together"
9,Young Rascals,Groovin',"Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of

Movin' down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can be anyone we like to be
All those happy people we could meet

Just groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No: no: no: no

(Ah: ah: ah)
(Ah: ah: ah)
(Ah: ah: ah)

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy: you and me endlessly

Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No: no: no: no
Groovin': uh huh
Groovin'"
10,Frankie Valli,Can't Take My Eyes Off You,"You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much

At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak

But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you: baby
And if it's quite alright: I need you: baby
To warm a lonely night: I love you: baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh: pretty baby
Don't bring me down: I pray: oh pretty baby
Now that I found you: stay
And let me love you: baby
Let me love you.

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much

At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you: baby
And if it's quite alright I need you: baby
To warm a lonely night: I love you: baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh: pretty baby
Don't bring me down: I pray: oh pretty baby
Now that I found you: stay: oh pretty baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh: pretty baby"
11,Music Explosion,Little Bit O' Soul,"Now when you're feelin' low and the fish won't bite
You need a little bit o' soul to put you right
You gotta make like you wanna kneel and pray
And then a little bit of soul will come your way

Now when your girl is gone and you're broke in two
You need a little bit o' soul to see you through
And when you raise the roof with your rock'n'roll
You'll get a lot more kicks with a little bit o' soul

And when your party falls 'cause ain't nobody groovin'
A little bit o' soul and it really starts movin': yeah

And when you're in a mess and you feel like cryin'
Just remember this little song of mine
And as you go through life tryin' to reach your goal
Just remember what I said about a little bit o'soul

A little bit o' soul: yeah (a little bit o' soul)"
12,Tommy James and The Shondells,I Think We're Alone Now,"""Children: behave""
That's what they say when we're together
""And watch how you play""
They don't understand

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me 
As we tumble to the ground and then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doing
'Cause what would they say
If they ever knew

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me 
As we tumble to the ground and then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now"

15,Bobby Vee and The Strangers,Come Back When You Grow Up,"Come back when you grow up: girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy: lovin's twice as tough
So come back: baby: when you grow up

You're lookin' real good: like a woman now
Your mind hasn't gotten the message somehow
So if you can't take it and the goin' gets rough
Come back: baby: when you grow up

I want you: girl: but your wide-eyed innocence
Has really messed up my mind: yeah
I'd rather you get your very first heartbreak
Somewhere else along the line

Come back when you grow up: girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Someday be a woman ready to love
Come back: baby: when you grow up

Come back when you grow up: girl
You're still livin' in a paper-doll world
Livin' ain't easy: lovin's twice as tough
So come back: baby: when you grow up

Come back when you grow up: girl
You've still got a lotta time left in the world
You'll someday be a woman ready to love

Come back when you grow up: girl

Livin' ain't easy: lovin's twice as tough"

24,Rolling Stones,Ruby Tuesday,"She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

Goodbye: Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye: Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

""There's no time to lose:"" I heard her say
""Catch your dreams before they slip away""
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?

Goodbye: Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye: Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you"
25,Vicki Carr,It Must Be Him,"I tell myself what's done is done
I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool

I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares: let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

Let it please be him: oh dear God
It must be him or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello: hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

After a while: I'm myself again
I take the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore

I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings: and once again
I start to pray

Let it please be him: oh dear God
It must be him: it must be him
Or I shall die: Or I shall die
Oh hello: hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die"

27,Buffalo Springfield,For What It's Worth,"There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop: children: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop: hey: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say: ""Hooray for our side""

It's time we stop: hey: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line: the man come and take you away

We better stop: hey: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?

You better stop: hey: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?

You better stop: now: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?

We better stop: children: what's that sound?
Everybody look: what's going down?"
28,Supremes,Love Is Here And Now You're Gone,"Love is here and
Oh: my darling: now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh: my darling: now: now you're gone

You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there

You close the door to your heart
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here and
Oh: my darling: now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh: my darling: now you're gone

You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked: just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith: then took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left it's trace

After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here and
Oh: my darling: now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh: my darling: now you're gone

You made me love you
Oh: my darling: now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh: my darling: now you're gone"
29,Supremes,The Happening,"Hey: life: look at me
I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me: took me out of my world
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love
You don't take care of
Then you better beware of the happening

One day you're up: then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me: and it can happen to you

I was sure: I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Yeah: riding high on top of the world
It happened: suddenly it just happened

I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you: the happening

Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams: ooh: it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

Once
Ooh: and then it happened
Ooh: and then it happened
Ooh: and then it happened
Ooh: and then it happened

Is it real: is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain: suddenly I started hurting

I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate
Yeah: came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

So sure: I felt secure
Until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't
Take care of: then you better beware of"

And turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face: at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face: at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face: at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh: I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh: when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust"

Should I tell her or should I keep cool?

When you do not see
I study the small things
You do constantly

I memorize moments

We won't even notice
The world turning cold

And so: in these moments
With sunlight above
My cup runneth over

My cup runneth over

Everything I do brings ecstasy: Oh: Yeah!
No wonder I could die
I feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high!
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)
Lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)

Found myself somebody. (He's been lonely)
Don't have to be alone no more. (He's been lonely: He's been lonely.)
Don't have to alone no more: no more. (He's been lonely: He's been lonely.)"
55,Beatles,Penny Lane,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane: there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane"

Swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there
Inside you

Hey there: Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window-shopping
But never stopping to buy
So: shed those dowdy feathers and fly
A little bit

Hey there: Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And: oh: what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Hey there: Georgy girl
Dreamin' of the someone you could be
Life is a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down from the shelf
A little bit

There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And: oh: what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

With the tide rolling in

And there we'll be
Beneath the midnight sky above
Just you and me
And we will whisper words of love while the fire light softly (soft) flickers in the sand

With the breeze blowing in
The time for love to begin
I would miss
California nights
If I went on my way
Thinking now that I'll stay

In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
For the only joy in life is to be loved

Keep on loving me
Bernadette: keep on needing me

uber dem schweinkomischen Hund und dem lieben Red Baron!

After the turn of the century
In the clear blue skies over Germany
Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the screamin' sound of a big war bird

Up in the sky: a man in a plane
Baron von Richthofen was his name
Eighty men tried: and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

Ten: twenty: thirty: forty: fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany

In the nick of time: a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down -
""Curses: foiled again!""

Ten: twenty: thirty: forty: fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany

Now: Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing: he got him in his sight

That bloody Red Baron was in a fix
He'd tried everything: but he'd run out of tricks
Snoopy fired once: and he fired twice
And that bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight

Ten: twenty: thirty: forty: fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany

Well: ten: twenty: thirty: forty: fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany"

When she turned and said
""But honey: he's not our kind.""

Can't see you anymore.

Everybody's acting deaf and dumb.

Think they believe it: then why won't they just let us be?

They say I can't see you anymore baby:
Can't see you anymore.

One of these days I'm gonna stop my listening
Gonna raise my head up high.
One of these days I'm gonna raise up my glistening wings and fly.
But that day will have to wait for a while.
Baby I'm only society's child.
When we're older things may change:
But for now this is the way: they must remain.

I say I can't see you anymore baby:
Can't see you anymore.
No: I don't want to see you anymore: baby."
86,Neil Diamond,"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon","Girl: you'll be a woman soon

I love you so much: can't count all the ways
I'd die for you girl: and all they can say is
""He's not your kind""
They never get tired of puttin' me down
And I never know when I come around
What I'm gonna find
Don't let them make up your mind
Don't you know

Girl: you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl: you'll be a woman soon
Soon you'll need a man

I've been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they're sayin': girl: just cuts like a knife
""The boy is no good""
Well: I finally found what I've been looking for
But if they get the chance: they'll end it for sure
Sure they would
Baby: I've done all I could
Now it's up to you

Girl: you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl: you'll be a woman soon
Soon you'll need a man

Oh girl: you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl: you'll be a woman soon
Soon: you'll need a man"
87,Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell,Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"Listen: baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough: baby

If you need me: call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far 
(Don't worry baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry

'Cause baby
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you baby

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you
You could always count on me?
From that day on: I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway: somehow

'Cause baby:
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you

No wind: no rain
Or winters cold
Can't stop me baby
(No: no baby)
'Cause you are my goal

If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me
Oh baby

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you

Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough"
88,Sandy Posey,I Take It Back,"Here he comes now
I've got to tell him somehow
I could put it off till later
But it's best I do it now

Baby: listen to me
There is something I must try to say
I've put it off so long
But I've decided that today is the day

My love for you is dying
Oh: no: please don't start crying"
89,Tremeloes,Here Comes My Baby,"One two: one two three four

In the midnight moonlight I'll
Be walking a long and lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you

Here comes my baby: here she comes now
And-a it becomes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well: here comes my baby: here she comes now
Walking with a love: with a love that's oh so fine
Never to be mine: no matter how I try

You'll never walk alone
And you're forever talking on the phone
I try to call you names
But every time it comes out the shame

Here comes my baby: here she comes now
And-a it becomes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well: here comes my baby: here she comes now
Walking with a love: with a love that's oh so fine
Never to be mine: no matter how I try

Here comes my baby: here she comes now
And-a it becomes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well: here comes my baby: here she comes now
Walking with a love: with a love that's oh so fine
Never to be mine: no matter how I try"
90,Robert Knight,Everlasting Love,"Hearts go astray: leaving hurt when they go 
I went away: just when you: you needed me so 
Filled with regret: I come back begging you
Won't you forget: welcome love we once knew 

Open up your eyes: then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my: everlasting love 
Need you by my side: girl to be my bride 
You'll never be denied: everlasting love 
From the very start: open up your heart 
Be a lasting part of everlasting love 

(Need a love to last forever) 
(Need a love to last forever) 

Where life's river flows: no one really knows 
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love 
Like the sun shines: endlessly it shines 
You always will be mine: it's eternal love 
When other's love-light's gone: ours will still be strong 
We'll have our very own: everlasting love 

(Real love to last forever) 
(Real love to last forever) 

Open up your eyes: then you'll realize 
Here I stand with my: everlasting love 
Need you by my side: girl to be my bride 
You'll never be denied: everlasting love 
From the very start: open up your heart 
Be a lasting part of everlasting love 
When other's love-light's gone: ours will still be strong 
We'll have our very own: everlasting love"
91,"Peter, Paul and Mary",I Dig Rock And Roll Music,"I dig rock and roll music
And I love to get the chance to play (And sing it)
I figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today
The message may not move me
Or mean a great deal to me
But hey! It feels so groovy to say

I dig The Mamas & The Papas at the trip Sunset Strip in L.A.
And they got a good thing goin' when the words don't get in the way
And when they're really wailing
Michelle and Cass are sailin'
Hey! They really nail me to the wall

I dig Donovan in a dream-like: tripped out way
His crystal images: hey: they tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when The Beatles tell you
They've got a word ""love"" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say

I dig rock and roll music
I could really get it on in that scene
I think I could say somethin' if you know what I mean
But if I really say it
The radio won't play it
Unless I lay it between the lines"
92,Bill Cosby,Little Ole Man (Uptight-Everything's Alright),
93,Electric Prunes,I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night,"Last night your shadow fell upon my lonely room
I touched your golden hair and tasted your perfume
Your eyes were filled with love the way they used to be
Your gentle hand reached out to comfort me
Then came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone: gone: gone

I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream
Last night

The room was empty as I staggered from my bed
I could not bear the image racing through my head
You were so real that I could feel your eagerness
And when you raised your lips for me to kiss

Came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone: gone: gone

Oh: too much to dream
Oh: too much to dream
Too much to dream last night
Oh: too much to dream"
94,Monkees,Daydream Believer,"7A.
What number is this: Chip?
7A!
Okay. I mean: don't get excited: man. It's 'cause I'm short: I know.

Oh: I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise: wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up: sleepy Jean
Oh: what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh and our good time starts and end without dollar one to spend
But how much: baby: do we really need?

Cheer up: sleepy Jean
Oh: what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up: sleepy Jean
Oh: what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

95,Johnny Rivers,Baby I Need Your Lovin',"Baby: I need your lovin'
Baby: I need your lovin'

Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day: another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby: I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby: I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep

Baby: I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby: I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Empty nights
Echo your name
Sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same

Oh yeah: when you see me smile
You know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

Darlin': I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me: darlin'
Makes me feel not alive: honey

Baby: I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby: I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby: I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'

I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way
Well: here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say
That you still want me
Well that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

I know you've deceived me: now here's a surprise
I know that you have 'cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze
Well here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles

97,Tommy James and The Shondells,Mirage,"I see you standing in the alleys and the hallways
(Wait a second)
You're gone now
I run to touch you: but you vanish through the doorway
And: oh: how
Hard it is to live without you
I love everything about you
Now I know you're really gone
But my imagination is so strong
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh: yeah: oh: want to be by my side
Oh: yeah: oh: now it's finally time
(Wait a second)

Mirage: that's all you are to me
Mirage: something I only see

So I keep walking through the alleys and the hallways
Where are you?
I keep remembering the kissing in the doorways
The car: too
How it all comes back to me
The movies every Saturday
The place we used to go to eat
I want so much to have it like it used to be
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh: yeah: oh: want to be by my side
Oh: yeah: oh: now it's finally time
(Here it comes again)

Mirage: that's all you are to me
Mirage: something I only see

Just a mirage: that's all you are to me
Just a mirage: something that I only see
Just a mirage: that's all you are to me
Just a mirage: something that I only see"
98,Tom Jones,"Green, Green Grass Of Home","The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green: green grass of home

Yes: they've all come to meet me
Arms reachin' smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green: green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green: green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize yes: I was only dreamin'
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green: green grass of home

Yes: they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green: green grass of home"
99,Petula Clark,Don't Sleep In The Subway,"You wander around
On your own little cloud
When you don't see the why
Or the wherefore

Ooh: you walk out on me
When we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for

I've heard it all a million times before
Take off your coat: my love: and close the door

Don't sleep in the subway: darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway: darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart
Then you take it apart
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
Um-m-um-um-um-um
You don't realize
That it's all compromise
And the problems are so over-rated

Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?

Don't sleep in the subway: darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway: darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Oh: oh: oh
Don't sleep in the subway: darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway: darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Oh: oh: oh: oh: oh

100,Neil Diamond,Thank The Lord For The Night Time,"Written by: Neil Diamond

Daytime turns me off: and I don't mean maybe
Nine-to-five ain't taking me where I'm bound
When it's done: I run out to see my baby
We get groovin' when the sun goes down

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up-: uptight time
Baby: chase it away
I get relaxation
It's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

I'll talk about plans now: baby: I got plenty
Nothing ever seems to turn out the way it should
Talk about money: girl: I ain't got any
Seems like just one time I'm feelin' good

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up-: uptight time
Baby: chase it away
I get relaxation
It's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you"
