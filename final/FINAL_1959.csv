1,Johnny Horton,The Battle Of New Orleans,"In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down the river and we seed the British come
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire till we seed their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em
Well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

2,Bobby Darin,Mack The Knife,"Oh: the shark: babe: has such teeth: dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath: babe
And he keeps it out of sight

You know when that shark bites with his teeth: babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves: though: wears old Macheath: babe
So there's never: never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk: ooh: sunny morning: uh-huh
Lies a body just oozin' life
Eek: and someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river: don't ya know
Where a cement bag's just a-droopin' on down
Oh: that cement is just: it's there for the weight: dear
Five'll get ya ten: old Macky's back in town

Now d'ya hear about Louie Miller? He disappeared: babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now Jenny Diver: ho: ho: yeah: Sukey Tawdry
Ooh: Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh: the line forms on the right: babe
Now that Macky's back in town

I said Jenny Diver: whoa: Sukey Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes: that line forms on the right: babe
Now that Macky's back in town

Look out ol' Macky's back"

4,Frankie Avalon,Venus,"Hey: Venus
Oh: Venus

Venus: if you will
Please send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you

Venus: make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus: goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

Venus: if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

5,Paul Anka,Lonely Boy,"I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want 
Is someone to love

Someone: yes someone to love
Someone to kiss
Someone to hold
At a moment like this

I'd like to hear
Somebody say
I'll give you my love
Each night and day

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want 
Is someone to love

Somebody: somebody: somebody: please
Send her to me
I'll make her happy
Just wait and see

I've prayed so hard
To the heavens above
That I might find
Someone to love

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything"
6,Bobby Darin,Dream Lover,"Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you
With a love oh so true
And a hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday: I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

'Cause I want a girl
To call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No: I don't want to dream alone
No"

9,Wilbert Harrison,Kansas City,"I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one

Gonna be standing on the corner
Twelfth Street and Vine
Gonna be standing on the corner
Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby
And a bottle of Kansas City wine

Well I might take a train
I might take a plane
But if I have to walk

Going to Kansas City

They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one

Aww But you know yeah must I

10,Fleetwoods,Mr. Blue,"Our guardian star lost all his glow
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no
And his silver turned to blue

Like him: I am doubtful
That your love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by going out on the sly
Proving your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around: heading for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mr.

I won't tell you
While you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too

But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue"
11,Santo and Johnny,Sleep Walk,
12,Paul Anka,Put Your Head On My Shoulder,"Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms: baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine: dear
Won't you kiss me once: baby
Just a kiss goodnight: maybe
You and I will fall in love

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear: baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me: tell me that you love me too.

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear: baby
Words I want to hear: baby
Put your head on my shoulder"
13,Lloyd Price,Stagger Lee,"The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark

It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
""I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat""

Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said: I cant get you Billy
But don't be here when I come back

Go on: Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44
Said: ""I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe""

Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said: ""Now nobody move""
And he pulled his .44

""Stagger Lee:"" cried Billy
""Oh: please don't take my life
I got three little children
And a very sickly wife""

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass

Now look out: Stagg: come on"

15,Dodie Stevens,Pink Shoelaces,
16,Platters,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Oh: I of course replied
Something here inside 
Cannot be denied

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh: when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
Oh: so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes: smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes"

Now a feller whose darling proved untrue
Took her life but he lost his too
Now he swings where the little birdie sings
And that's where Tom Dooley met his Waterloo

71,Wink Martindale,Deck Of Cards,"Narrative:
During the North African campaign: a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday: several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer:
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out: but this one boy had only a deck of cards: and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said: ""Soldier: put away those
Cards."" After the services was over: the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall.

The Marshall said: ""Sergeant: why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church: Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself: son?"" ""Much: Sir:"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said: ""I
Hope so: for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said: ""Sir: I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book: but I hope to satisfy
You: Sir: with the purity of my intentions."" And with that: the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir: when I look at the Ace: it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts: the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey: I think
Of the Father: the Son: and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four: I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew:


Mark: Luke and John. And when I see the Five: it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved: five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six: it reminds me that in six days: God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven: it reminds me that on the seventh day: God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight: I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah: his wife: their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine: I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed: and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten: I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King: it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven: God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen: I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary: who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards: I find 365: the number of days in a year.
There are 52 cards: the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits: the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards: the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks: the number of weeks in a quarter.
So you see: Sir: my pack of cards serves me as a Bible: an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

I only have eyes for you: dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you"

77,Kingston Trio,The Tijuana Jail,"We went one day about a month ago (ha ha ha) to have a little fun (ah ha) in Mexico.
We ended up in a gambling spot (ha ha ha) where the liquor flowed and the dice were hot.

So: here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail.
So: here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail.

I was shooting dice: raking in the dough (long green) and then I heard a whistle blow.
We started to run when a man in blue said: ""Senor: come with me 'cause I want you.""

So: here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail.
So: here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail.

Just five hundred dollars and they'll set us free. I couldn't raise a penny if they threatened me.
I know five hundred don't sound like much (cheap): but just try to find somebody to touch.

So: here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail.
So: here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail.

Ah: just a little too much
You know you thrill me baby
With your magic touch
That's why I want you: honey
And love you like I do
I'm gonna scream and shout it
There ain't no doubt about it
That's why I love you like I do

Well: sometimes I think you kiss me
Ah: just a little too much
You drive me crazy: baby
With your magic touch
You make me feel so good
When the moon is shining bright
With our lips together
And you're squeezing me so tight
Well: I went steady once before
Thought I loved the girl next door
She stepped out on me you see
Couldn't be true
Well: I got over all my dreams
Time went by so fast it seems
Now I know I'll never get over you
Oh now...

Sometimes I think I love you
Ah: just a little too much

80,Coasters,Along Came Jones,"I flopped down in my easy chair and turned on channel 2
A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was a-chasin' poor sweet Sue
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh
""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch: I'll saw you all in half""

And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He turned on the buzz saw (And then? And then?)

Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall: thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely: lanky Jones

Commercial came on: so I got up to get myself a snack
You should've seen what was going on by the time that I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine: sweet Sue was a-havin' fits
That villain said: ""Give me the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits""

And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (And then? And then?)

Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall: thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely: lanky Jones

I got so bugged: I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was a-tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said: ""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch: I'm gonna throw you on the railroad track""

And then he grabbed her (And then?)
He tied her up (And then?)
He threw her on the railroad track (And then?)
A train started coming (And then? And then?)

Ack-ack
And then along came Jones
Tall: thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came lonely: lanky Jones
Along came lonely: lanky Jones"

Is a star without a light

All your life you'll never be
A girl without a boy

My only desire is loving you eternally 
For no: no other love could ever mean so much to me 
So if you say you love me forever I'll be true 
And what more could I long for than to live my life with you

I could never be loved by anyone sweeter than you 
And I could never belong to anyone sweeter than you"

Wind is a blowing: rain starts to fall
Train is a tooting its long: lonesome call
Wheels are clicking their way down the track
Counting the days till he's coming back

When he has traveled the land and the sea
He'll stop his wandering and come home to me
Give me a kiss for each tear and each sigh
Till then my Jimmy: my Jimmy: goodbye"

But the day that I stop counting: that's the day my world will end

Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back but never meant to stay

Yes: I've got

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

When I met you
I'd searched and searched
My whole life through

There's just one thing
Dear before we start
Don't say you care
Then break my heart

When you speak of love
Please be sincere
For if you play with love
It can bring tears my dear

My wish came true
To my surprise
When you stood there before my eyes

And when my heart
Started beating fast
T'was then I knew
I'd found true love at last"

Who lost his love when he turned bad

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her I had to see the world
Or tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail
Oh: don't tell her I'm in jail

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please don't mention the stagecoach
And the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding day
But please don't mention my lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying day

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart's aching for Mary
Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold
Oh: Lord: this cell is cold

Mary: Mary
Oh: Lord this cell is cold"
98,Mormon Tabernacle Choir,Battle Hymn Of The Republic,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored:
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on.

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on.

I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel:


""As ye deal with my condemners: So with you my grace shall deal;""
Let the Hero: born of woman: crush the serpent with his heel
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat
Oh: be swift: my soul: to answer Him! be jubilant: my feet!
Our God is marching on.

Ln the beauty of the lillies Christ was born across the sea:
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:
As He died to make men holy: let us die to make men free:
While God is marching on."
