1,Perez Prado,Cherry Pink And Apple Blossom White,"It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
When your true lover comes your way
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
When your true lover comes your way
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
The poets say

The story goes that once a cherry tree
Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes: it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs: the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed: the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined

And that is why the poets always write
If there's a new moon bright above
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
When you're in love"
2,Bill Haley and His Comets,Rock Around The Clock,"One: two: three o'clock: four o'clock rock
Five: six: seven o'clock: eight o'clock rock
Nine: ten: eleven o'clock: twelve o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight

Put your glad rags on: join me: hon'
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock: rock: rock till broad daylight
We're gonna rock: gonna rock around the clock tonight

When the clock strikes two: three and four
If the band slows down: we'll yell for more
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock: rock: rock till broad daylight
We're gonna rock: gonna rock around the clock tonight

When the chimes ring five: six: and seven
We'll be right in seventh heaven

When it's eight: nine: ten: eleven too

When the clock strikes twelve: we'll cool off then
Start a-rockin' round the clock again

We're gonna rock: rock: rock till broad daylight
We're gonna rock: gonna rock around the clock tonight"
3,Mitch Miller,The Yellow Rose Of Texas,"There's a yellow rose in Texas that I am gonna see
Nobody else could miss her: not half as much as me
She cried so when I left her: it was like it broke her heart
And if I ever find her: we never more will part

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds: they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me

Where the Rio Grand is flowing and the starry skies are bright
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
I know that she remembers when we parted long ago
I promise to return and not to leave her so

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me

Now I'm gonna find her for my heart is full of woe
We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily: she'll loves me like before
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forever more

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds: they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me"
4,Roger Williams,Autumn Leaves,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips: the summer kisses
The sunburned hand I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all: my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

I see your lips: the summer kisses
The sunburned hand I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all: my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall"
5,Les Baxter,Unchained Melody,"Unchain me: unchain me
Unchain me: unchain me
Unchain me

Unchain me: unchain me
Unchain me: unchain me

Oh: my love: my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long: lonely time

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love: I need your love
God speed your love to me"
6,Bill Hayes,The Ballad Of Davy Crockett,"Davy: Davy Crockett: king of the wild frontier

Born on a mountain top in Tennessee
The greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so he knew ev'ry tree
Kilt him a b'ar when he was only three
Davy: Davy Crockett: king of the wild frontier

He fought single-handed through the Injun War
Till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend for evermore
Davy: Davy Crockett: king of the wild frontier

When he lost his love an' his grief was gall
In his heart he wanted to leave it all
And lose himself in the forests tall
But he answered instead his country's call
Davy: Davy Crockett: choice of the whole frontier

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
Fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
Took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
An' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy: Davy Crockett: servin' his country well

When he come home his politickin' done
The western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
An' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy: Davy Crockett: leadin' the pioneer

His land is biggest an' his land is best
From grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test
Followin' his legend into the West
Davy: Davy Crockett: king of the wild frontier

King of the wild frontier"
7,Four Aces,Love Is A Many Splendored Thing,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill: In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes: true love's a many splendored thing

Once on a high and windy hill: In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes: true love's a many splendored thing"

9,Pat Boone,Ain't That A Shame,"You made me cry 
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame 
My tears fell like rain 
Ain't that a shame 
You' re the one to blame 

You broke my heart 
When you said we're apart 
Ain't that a shame
My tears fell like rain 
Ain't that a shame 
You' re the one to blame 

Oh well goodbve 
Although I'll cry 
Ain't that a shame 
My tears fell like rain 
Ain't that a shame 
You' re the one to blame"

11,Crazy Otto,Crazy Otto Medley I and II,
12,Billy Vaughn,Melody Of Love,"Waltz tempo
Hold me in your arms: dear: dream with me
Cradled by your kisses: tenderly
While a choir of angels from above
Sings our melody of love

Heart to heart forever: lips entwined
I am yours and you are mine: all mine
Heaven wrote the music up above
For our melody of love

Melody of love"
13,Tennessee Ernie Ford,Sixteen Tons,"Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number-nine coal
And the straw boss said: ""Well bless my soul!""

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning: it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebreak by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't: a lotta men died
One fist of iron: the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store"
14,Frank Sinatra,Learnin' The Blues,"The tables are empty - the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song - it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning - just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson - in learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light - one after another
Won't help you forget her - and the way that you love her
You're only burning - a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track - for learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone: the blues will taunt you - constantly
When you're out in a crowd: the blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep - the whole night you're crying
You just can't forget her - soon you even stop trying
You'll walk the floor - and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break - you're learnin' the (those) blues"
15,Fontaine Sisters,Hearts Of Stone,
16,Georgia Gibbs,Tweedle Dee,"Tweedle dee dee: tweedle dee dee
Tweedle dee dee: tweedle dee dee

Tweedle tweedle tweedle dee
I'm as happy as can be.
Jimminy cricket: jimminy jack:
You make my heart go clickety-clack.
Tweedle tweedle tweedle dee

Tweedle tweedle tweedle dot
How you gonna keep that honey you got
Hunkies hunkies fish that bite

17,Four Lads,Moments To Remember,"January to December: we'll have moments to remember

The New Year's Eve we did the town
The day we tore the goal post down
We'll have these moments to remember

The quiet walks: the noisy fun
The ballroom prize we almost won
We will have these moments to remember

Though summer turns to winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years

When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember

spoken:

The drive in movie where we'd go
And somehow never watched the show
We will have these moments to remember

Though summer turns to winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years

When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember"
18,Chordettes,Mr. Sandman,"Mr. Sandman: bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman: I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman: bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman: bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman: I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman: bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman (Yes?) bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mr. Sandman: someone to hold (Someone to hold)
Would be so peachy before we're too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman: bring us: please: please: please
Mr. Sandman: bring us a dream"
19,Joan Weber,Let Me Go Lover,
20,Nat King Cole,A Blossom Fell,"A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
The gypsies say and I know why
""A falling blossom only touches lips that lie.""

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied"
21,Al Hibbler,Unchained Melody,"Oh: my love: my darling:
I've hungered for your touch a long: lonely time:
Time goes by so slowly and time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love: I need your love: God speed your love to me.

Lonely rivers flow to the sea: to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh: ""Wait for me: wait for me""
""I'll be coming home: wait for me!""

Are you still mine?
I need your love: I need your love: God speed your love to me"

25,Perry Como,Ko Ko Mo,

27,Ames Brothers,The Naughty Lady Of Shady Lane,"The naughty lady of Shady Lane has hit the town like a bomb
The back fence gossip ain't been this good since Mabel ran off with Tom
Our town was peaceful and quiet before she came on the scene
The lady has started a riot: disturbin' the suburban routine

The naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl
The naughty lady of Shady Lane. Me: oh my: oh what a girl

You should see how she carries on with her admirants galore
She must be giving them quite a thrill: the way they flock to her door
She throws those ""come hither"" glances at every Tom: Dick and Joe
When offered some liquid refreshment: the lady never: never says: ""No""

The naughty lady of Shady Lane has the town in a whirl
The naughty lady of Shady Lane. Me: oh my: oh what a girl

The things they're trying to pin on her won't hold much water: I'm sure
Beneath the powder and fancy lace: there beats a heart sweet and pure
She just needs someone to change her and she'll be nice as can be
If you're in the neighbourhood: stranger: you're welcome to drop in and see

The naughty lady of Shady Lane: so delightful to hold
The naughty lady of Shady Lane. So delectable: quite respectable

And she's only nine days old"
28,Jaye P. Morgan,That's All I Want From You,"A little love that slowly grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

A sunny day with bolts up to the sky
A kiss and no goodbye
That's all I want from you

Don't let me down: oh show me that you care
Remember when you give: you also get your share
Don't let me down: I have no time to waste
Tomorrow might not come: when dreamers dream too late

A little love that slowly grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

Don't let me down: oh show me that you care
Remember when you give: you also get your share
Don't let me down: I have no time to waste
Tomorrow might not come: when dreamers dream too late

A little love that slowly grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you

That's all I want from you"
29,Platters,Only You,"Only you can make all this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true: you are my destiny
When you hold my hand
I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true: you are my destiny
When you hold my hand
I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

One and only you"
30,Somethin' Smith and The Redheads,It's A Sin To Tell A Lie,"Be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you: yes I do: I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie

Cross my heart and I hope to die
I'll never: never: ever tell another white lie
Took a little doll out on a date last night
Next to her: *Gravel Gertie* would have looked all right
Now I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea
'Cause I said ""Baby: you look good to me""
I told her I loved her but: oh: how I lied
And now she's gettin' set to be my blushin' bride
If she leads me to the altar: then I'm sunk
'Cause I can't tell the preacher I was drunk
So Lord have mercy on a no 'count sinner
Give me one more chance to let another guy win 'er
Cross my heart and I hope to die
I'll never: never: EVER tell another white lie.

Be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you: yes I do: I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure it's true when you say ""I love you""
It's a sin to tell a lie"
