1,Elvis Presley,All Shook Up,"Oh well bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Hmm hmm hmm: hmm hmm
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh well my hands are shaky
And my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Hmm hmm hmm: hmm hmm
Yeah yeah yeah

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up: but I feel fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so: it scares me to death

She touched my hand
And what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Hmm hmm hmm: hmm hmm
Yeah yeah yeah

My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine

She touched my hand
And what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Hmm hmm hmm: hmm hmm
Yeah yeah yeah

Hmm hmm hmm: hmm hmm
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm all shook up"

4,Tab Hunter,Young Love,"They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

Young love: first love
Filled with true devotion
Young love: our love
We share with deep emotion

Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that you love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me

Young love: first love
Filled with true devotion
Young love: our love
We share with deep emotion"
5,Jimmy Dorsey,So Rare,"(So rare: so rare)
(So rare: so rare)

So rare: you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air fresh with the morning dew
So rare: you're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane couldn't compare to you

You are perfection: you're my idea
Of angels singin' the ""Ave Maria""
Or you're an angel: I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare: this is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care: ours is a love so rare

(So rare: so rare)
(So rare: so rare)

(You are perfection: you're my idea)
(Of angels singin' the ""Ave Maria"")
Or you're an angel: I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare: (so rare) this is the heaven on earth we share (so rare)
Caring the way we care (so rare) ours is a love so rare

6,Pat Boone,Don't Forbid Me,"Don't forbid me to hold you tight
A-darlin': don't-a forbid me to hold you tight
Let me hold you in my lovin' arms
'Cause it's cold and I can keep you warm

A-don't-a forbid me to kiss your lips
A-darlin' don't-a forbid me to kiss your lips
Let me kiss you please: baby: please
'Cause it's cold and your lips might freeze

Well: there's a strong west wind a-blowin'
And there's a big blue moon above
And: pretty baby: I've been knowin'
You need some heart-warmin' love

So don't-a forbid me to talk sweet talk
Darlin' don't-a forbid me to talk sweet talk
Let me fill your little heart with fire
'Cause it's cold: so don't forbid my desire

It's so cold (it's so cold)
So don't forbid-a my desire
(Don't forbid my desire)"
7,Guy Mitchell,Singing The Blues,"Well: I never felt more like singin' the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear: why'd you do me this way?
Well: I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause everythin's wrong: and nothin' ain't right
Without you: you got me singin' the blues.

The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But cry-why-why-why over you (cry over you)
Well: I never felt more like runnin' away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay
Without you: you got me singin' the blues.

Well: I never felt more like singin' the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear: why'd you do me this way?
Well: I never felt more like cryin' all night
'Cause everythin's wrong: and nothin' ain't right
Without you: you got me singin' the blues.

Oh: the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothin' left for me to do
But cry-why-why-why over you (cry over you)
Well: I never felt more like runnin' away
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay
Without you: you got me singin' the blues"

Young love our love we share with deep emotion
Just one kiss from your sweet lips will tell me that your love is real

Love for you or for me
Young love first love..."
9,Elvis Presley,Too Much,"Well honey I love you
Too much
I need your loving
Too much

Want the thrill of
Your touch
Gee I can't love
Too much

You do all the living
While I do all the giving
'Cause I love you
Too much

Well you spend all my money
Too much
I have to share you honey
Too much

When I want some lovin'
You're gone
Don't you know you're treating
Your daddy wrong

Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you
Too much

I need your loving
All the time
Need your hugging
Meeting mine

Need you near me
Stay real close
Please: please hear me
You're the most

Now you've got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you
Too much

Every time I kiss your
Sweet lips
I can feel my heart go
Flip-flip

I'm such a fool for
Your charms
Take me back: baby
In your arms

Like to hear you sighing
Even though I know you're lying
'Cause I love you
Too much

I need your loving
All the time
Need your hugging
Meeting mine

Need you near me
Stay real close
Please: please hear me
You're the most

Now you've got me started
Don't you leave me broken hearted
'Cause I love you
Too much"

11,Everly Brothers,Bye Bye Love,"Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry

Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye: my love: goodbye

There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy: I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry

Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye: my love: goodbye

I'm-a through with romance: I'm a-through with love
I'm through with a-countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness

Hello emptiness

16,Elvis Presley,Jailhouse Rock,"The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock: everybody: let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash: boom: bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock: everybody: let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me""

Let's rock: everybody: let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock
Rock: rock: r...

Sad Sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said: ""Hey: buddy: don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair""

Let's rock: everybody: let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs: ""For heaven's sake
No one's looking: now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said: ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks""

Let's rock: everybody: let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock"

I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue blue mood.

22,Chuck Berry,School Day,"Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You study 'em hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open you books
Gee but the teacher don't know
How mean she looks

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books: get out of your seat

Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot

With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you been
Wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round you go

Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot

With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you been
Wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round you go

Hail: hail rock 'n' roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock 'n' roll
The beat of the drum is loud and bold
Rock rock rock 'n' roll
The feelin' is there body and soul"
23,Ferlin Husky,Gone,"Since you've gone the moon the sun the stars in the sky know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine now you've gone
Since you've gone my heart my lips my tear dimmed eyes a lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart broke your heart now you've gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted I was wrong now you've gone

Oh what I'd give for the lifetime..."

A teenager's romance is fickle or true
A teenager's romance is red hot or blue
You're either in misery or high on a crest
A teenager's romance is like all the rest

They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves: dear
What's black and what's white

Keep saying you love me
And they'll look upon
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on

They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves: dear

Keep saying you love me

That goes on and on

A teenager's romance
That goes on and on"

27,Jimmie Rodgers,Honeycomb,"(Honeycomb)
(Honeycomb)

Well it's a darn good life
And it's kinda funny
How the Lord made the bee
And the bee made the honey
And the honeybee lookin' for a home
And they called it honeycomb

And they roamed the world
And they gathered all
Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And the honeycomb from a million trips
Made my baby's lips

Oh: Honeycomb: won't you be my baby
Well: Honeycomb: be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb

Well: Honeycomb: won't you be my baby
Well: Honeycomb: be my own
What a darn good life
When you got a wife like Honeycomb

(Honeycomb)

And the Lord said now that I made a bee
I'm gonna look all around for a green: green tree
And He made a little tree and I guess you heard
Oh: then well he made a little bird

And they waited all around until the end of Spring
Gettin' every note that the birdies sing
And they put 'em all into one sweet tome
For my Honeycomb

Oh: Honeycomb: won't you be my baby
Well: Honeycomb: be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb

Well: Honeycomb: won't you be my baby
Well: Honeycomb: be my own
What a darn good life
When you got a wife like Honeycomb

(Honeycomb)

And the Lord said now that I made a bird
I'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word
That sounds about sweet like ""turtledove""
And I guess I'm gonna call it ""love""

And He roamed the world lookin' everywhere
Gettin' love from here: love from there
And He put it all in a little ol' part
Of my baby's heart

Oh: Honeycomb: won't you be my baby
Well: Honeycomb: be my own
Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb

Well: Honeycomb: won't you be my baby
Well: Honeycomb: be my own
What a darn good life

32,Frankie Laine,Moonlight Gambler,"You can gamble for match sticks: you can gamble for gold.
The stakes may be heavy or small.
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost:
You haven't gambled at all.

So they call me a moonlight gambler.
Well: I've gambled for love and lost.
When I gamble for love but it isn't in the cards:
Oh: what heartaches it can cost me.

Win or lose: I'm a moonlight gambler:
And a winner is what I long to be.
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live:
Till the day Lady Luck smiles down on me.

Well: you can gamble for match sticks:
You can gamble for gold.
Stakes may be heavy or small.
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost:
Well: then you haven't gambled at all.

No: if you haven't gambled for love in the moonlight:
Then you haven't gambled at all.

So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live:
Till the day Lady Luck smiles down on me.

So they call me the moonlight gambler.

Is just not the way it used to be""

Don't call it a teen-age crush

I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last

As far as I can see: This is heaven
And speaking just for me: It's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then it's not for me to say

Leave your fat old Nanna home
She never will say yes
If mamma don't know now
She can guess: my: my: yes

All night: all day: Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand

When she walks along the shore
People pause to greet
While birds fly around her
Little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love: but I'm the only mortal man
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne
Don't rush me

All night: all day: Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand

When we marry: we will have
A time you never saw
I will be so happy
I will kiss my mother-in-law

One for every palm tree: and cok-y-nut: Hurry up now

39,Johnny Mathis,Chances Are,"Chances are: 'cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you

Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are you think my heart's your valentine

In the magic of moonlight
When I sigh ""Hold me close: dear.""
Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies
Are in my eyes

Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well: chances are your chances are awfully good

Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies

Watchin' till the mornin' comes creepin'

There's an old piano
And they play it hot
Behind the green door
Don't know what they're doin'
But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out
What's behind the green door

(Knocked once
Tried to tell 'em I've been there
Door slammed
Hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's goin' on in there)

Saw an eyeball peepin'
Through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me
Someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door
All I want to do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door

Watchin' till the mornin' comes creepin'

46,Patti Page,Old Cape Cod,"If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air
Quaint little villages here and there
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod

If you like the taste of a lobster stew
Served by a window with an ocean view
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod

Winding roads that seem to beckon you
Miles of green beneath the skies of blue
Church bell chiming on a Sunday morn
Remind you of the town where you were born

If you spend an evening you'd want to stay
Watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod."

Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

Though we're apart: you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day
And Friday I'll get my pay

Saturday mornin': oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone away
Got my money and my honey

And we breathe in the cool salty air.
You turn to me: with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare.
Then your lips cling to mine: it's wonderful: wonderful
Oh: so wonderful: my love.

Sometimes we stand: on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky.
I turn to you: and you melt in my arms
Here we are: Darling: only you and I.
What a moment to share: it's wonderful: wonderful
Oh: so wonderful: my love.

The world is full of wondrous things: it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you.

Some quiet evening: I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own.
I feel the glow of your arms open love
I'm aware of the treasure that I hold.
And I say to myself ""It's wonderful: wonderful
Oh: so wonderful: my love.'

57,Harry Belafonte,Jamaica Farewell,"Down the way
Where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackee: rice: saltfish are nice
And the rum is fine any time o' year

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down
My head is turning around 
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town

Smile on your zing gang a zula
Moon shine above
On your sweet jungle love
For you my bolo is swinging
For you my love song I'm singing
Come be my Hula Hula love

But the chieftain from the peaceful Filalilla land
Would not give him her hand
Her lover took his stand
Through the rattle of the battle
As she heard his sweet voice calm and true
They fled in his canoe over water blue

Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for hating
So here where you left me I'll stay

One night with you is like heaven
And so while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door"

To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya!

Sing that song again for me
So soft and low: just as though
You had me on your knee!

A million baby kisses: that I would deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River &#x2013;
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody!

In a far and distant land

So beneath God's blue heaven
There's a place that I must go
See the sun set in the evening
With the only girl I know

We watched the sun set in the evening
See the moon yellow and pale
Watch the gaucho's ride the pinto's
All across the pampas trail

Where the deep blue pearly waters
Wash upon while silver sands
There on the brink of love I kissed her
And obeyed our hearts command"

But oh what I got to go through
And so dear I guess the answer is simply
Who needs you: I do

Each time we kiss goodnight
I find that I get so excited
I can't sleep all night
I've lost my appetite
No appetite no sleep at night

Who needs you: I'd like to know

I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name What's your name
What's your name What's your name

Young blood: young blood: young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said: ""You'd better leave my daughter alone""

I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin'
You're the one: you're the one
You're the one: you're the one

Young blood: young blood: young blood
I can't get you out of my mind"

79,Chuck Berry,Rock and Roll Music,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat: you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat: you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man: they were blowin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat: you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks: they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat: you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a-rockin' that piano

So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat: you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me"
