1,Kitty Kallen,Little Things Mean A Lot,"Blow me a kiss from across the room
Say I look nice when I'm not
Touch my hair as you pass my chair
Little things mean a lot
Give me your arm as we cross the street
Call me at six on the dot
A line a day when you're far away
Little things mean a lot
Don't have to buy me diamonds or pearls
Champagne: sables: and such


I never cared much for diamonds and pearls
'Cause honestly: honey: they just cost money
Give me a hand when I've lost the way
Give me your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is bright or gray
Give me your heart to rely on
Send me the warmth of a secret smile
To show me you haven't forgot
For now and forever: that's always and ever
Honey: little things mean a lot"
2,Perry Como,Wanted,"Wanted
Someone who kissed me
And held me closely
Then stole my heart

Wanted
Someone I trusted
Who gave no warning
We'd ever part

She was last seen
Hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing
Of the danger in her charms

A jury
May find her guilty
But I'd forgive her
If I could see

A signed confession
That she's repented
And really wanted
No one but me

Wanted
Someone who kissed me
And held me closely
Then stole my heart

Wanted
Someone I trusted
Who gave no warning
That we'd ever part

She was last seen
Hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing
Of the danger in her charms

A jury
May find her guilty
But I'd forgive her
If I could see

A signed confession
That she's repented
And really wanted
No one but me"
3,Rosemary Clooney,Hey There,"Lately when I'm in my room
All by myself
In the solitary gloom
I call to myself

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You use to be too wise

Hey there
You on that high flyin' cloud
Though he won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday he'll come to you

Better forget him
Him with his nose in the air
He has you dancin' on a string
Break it and he won't care

Won't you take this advice I hand you like a mother
Or are you not seein' things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all goin' in one ear and out the other

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
(Are you talking to me?)
Love never made a fool of you
(Not until now)
You used to be too wise
(Yes: I was once)

Will you take this advice I hand you like a mother
Or am I not seein' things too clear
Are you just too far gone to hear?
Is it all goin' in one ear and out the other"

7,Four Knights,I Get So Lonely,
8,Four Aces,Three Coins In The Fountain,"Three coins in the fountain
Each one seeking happiness
(Thrown by three hopeful lovers)
(Which one will the fountain bless?)

Three hearts in the fountain
Each heart longing for its home
(There they lie in the fountain)
(Somewhere in the heart of Rome)

Which one will the fountain bless?
Which one will the fountain bless?

Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
(Just one wish will be granted)
(One heart will wear a valentine)

Make it mine!
Make it mine!
Make it mine!

Which one will the fountain bless?
Which one will the fountain bless?

Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
(Just one wish will be granted)
(One heart will wear a valentine)

Make it mine!
Make it mine!
Make it mine!"
9,Doris Day,Secret Love,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore"
10,Archie Bleyer,Hernando's Hideaway,"(From the musical ""The Pajama Game"" by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross)


I know a dark secluded place
A place where no one knows your face
A glass of wine: a fast embrace
It's called Hernando's Hideaway
Ole!

And all you'll see are silhouettes
And all you'll hear are castanets
And no one cares how late it gets
Not at Hernando's Hideaway
Ole!

At the Golden Fingerbowl or any place you go
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
But if you'll go the spot that I am thinkin' of
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love

Just knock three times and whisper low
That you and I were sent by Joe
Then strike a match and you will know
You're in Hernando's Hideaway
Ole!

Just knock three times and whisper low
That you and I were sent by Joe
Then strike a match and you will know
You're in Hernando's Hideaway"
11,Frank Sinatra,Young At Heart,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you
If you're young at heart

For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams
Fall apart at the seams

And life gets more exciting
With each passing day
And love is either in your heart
Or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart

For as rich as you are
It's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Think of all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart..."
12,Rosemary Clooney,This Ole House,"This ole house once knew his children
This ole house once knew his wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As they fought the storms of life

This old house once rang with laughter
This old house heard many shouts
Now he trembles in the darkness
When the lightnin' walks about

(Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer)
(Ain't a-gonna need this house no more)
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor

Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

This ole house is a-gettin' shaky
This ole house is a-gettin' old
This ole house lets in the rain
This ole house lets in the cold

On his knees are a-gettin' chilly
But he feel no fear nor pain
'Cause he see an angel peekin'
Through a broken windowpane

(Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer)
(Ain't a-gonna need this house no more)
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor

Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

This ole house is afraid of thunder
This ole house is afraid of storms
This ole house just groans and trembles
When the night wind flings its arms

This ole house is gettin' feeble
This old house is needin' paint
Just like him it's tuckered out
But he's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

(Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer)
(Ain't a-gonna need this house no more)
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor

Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

(Ready to meet the saints)"
13,Eddie Fisher,I Need You Now,"If I ever needed you: I need you now
I can't remember when I've ever been so blue
If I ever needed love: I need it now
I feel so all alone I don't know what to do

No day or night goes by
When I don't have my cry
I feel like I could die
From wanting you

I can ease my achin' heart: but you'd know how
If I ever needed you: I need you now

If I ever needed love: I need it now
I feel so all alone I don't know what to do

No day or night goes by
When I don't have my cry
I feel like I could die
From wanting you

I can ease my achin' heart: honey you'd know how
If I ever needed you: I need you now"
14,Patti Page,Cross Over The Bridge,"If you're a guy that's had a gal in each and every port
And you've forgot the rules of love that life has always taught
And if you broke as many hearts as ripples in a stream
Well: brother: here's the only way that you can be redeemed

Cross over the bridge: cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin': cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother: cross over the bridge

If you have built a boat to take you to the greener side
And if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied
You'll never reach the Promised Land of love: I guarantee
'Cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea

Cross over the bridge: cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin': cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother: cross over the bridge

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
'Cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

Cross over the bridge: cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin': cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother: cross over the bridge

Cross over the bridge

Cross over the bridge

Cross over the bridge"
15,Gaylords,The Little Shoemaker,
16,Dean Martin,That's Amore,"(In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl here's what they say)

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling: ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay: tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasul
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming signore
Scuzzi me: but you see: back in old Napoli
That's amore

When the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling: ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay: tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella
Lucky Fella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasul
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming signore
Scusami: but you see: back in old Napoli
That's amore: (amore)
That's amore"
17,Frank Weir,The Happy Wanderer,"I love to go a-wandering
Along the mountain track
And as I go: I love to sing
My knapsack on my back

Val-deri: Val-dera
Val-deri
Val-dera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Val-deri: Val-dera
My knapsack on my back

I love to wander by the stream
That dances in the sun
So joyously it calls to me
""Come! Join my happy song""

I wave my hat to all I meet
And they wave back to me
And blackbirds call so loud and sweet
From ev'ry green wood tree

High overhead: the skylarks wing
They never rest at home
But just like me: they love to sing
As o'er the world we roam

Oh: may I go a-wandering
Until the day I die
Oh: may I always laugh and sing
Beneath God's clear blue sky"
18,Nat King Cole,Answer Me My Love,"Answer me: oh: my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of?
Tell me how I came to lose your love
Please answer me: sweetheart

You were mine yesterday
I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me where I've gone astray?
Please answer me: my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew?
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me: my love

(If you're happier without me)
(I'll try not to care)
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know (you must know) I've been true (I've been true)
Won't you say that we can start anew?
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me: my love

Answer me: my love"
19,Tony Bennett,Stranger In Paradise,"Take my hand
I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise

If I stand starry eyed
That's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you

I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest

Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance that you care

Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for

But open your angel's arms
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"
20,Doris Day,If I Give My Heart To You,"If I give my heart to you 
Will you handle it with care 
Will you always treat me tenderly 
And in every way be fair 

If I give my heart to you 
Will you give me all your love 
Will you swear that you'll be true to me 
By the light that shines above 

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad 
Smile with me when I'm glad 
And always be as you are with me tonight 

Think it over and be sure 
Please don't answer till you do 
When you promise all those things to me 
Then I'll give my heart to you 

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad 
Smile with me when I'm glad 
And always be as you are with me tonight 

Think it over and be sure 
Please don't answer till you do 
When you promise all those things to me 
Then I'll give my heart to you"
21,Kay Starr,If You Love Me (Really Love Me),"If the sun should tumble from the sky:
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me: really love me:
Let it happen I won't care
If a dream I fear should fall apart
I can still be smiling with my heart
If you love me: really love me:
Let it happen darling I won't care
Shall I catch a shooting star:
Shall I bring it where you are
If you only say you care
I can make a mountain fall
I'll do anything at all
As long as you are there
When at last my life on earth is through:
I will share eternity with you
If you love me: really love me:
Let it happen darling I won't care

Let it happen darling I won't care"
22,Ralph Marterie,Skokiaan,
23,Don Cornell,Hold My Hand,"So this the kingdom of Heaven
So this is the sweet Promised Land
While angels tell of love
Don't break the spell of love: hold my hand

So this is the garden of Eden
In dreams it was never so grand
Let's never leave again
Adam and Eve again: hold my hand

This is the secret of what bliss is
For bliss is what your kiss is
At last I understand

So this is the kingdom of Heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now
We'll be immortal now: hold my hand

So this is the kingdom of heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now
We'll be immortal now: hold my hand
Hold my hand"
24,Patti Page,Changing Partners,"We were waltzin' together to a dreamy melody 
When they called out ""Change partners"" 
And you waltzed away from me 
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor 
And I'll keep on changing partners 
Till I hold you once more 

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part 
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart 
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then 
Oh: my darlin' I will never change partners again 

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part 
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart 
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then 
Oh: my darlin' I will never change partners again"

27,Tony Bennett,Rags To Riches,"I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire

My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure that I'm hopin' for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine ever more

Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you

Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
