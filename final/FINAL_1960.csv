1,Percy Faith,"Theme From ""A Summer Place""", Instrumental
2,Jim Reeves,He'll Have To Go,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do
Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you you want me answer yes or no
Darling I will understand

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend that we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you
He'll have to go"
3,Everly Brothers,Cathy's Clown,"Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses: that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
""Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown.""

I've gotta stand tall
You know a man can't crawl
But when he knows you're tellin' lies
And he hears them passing' by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses: that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
""Here he comes. That's Cathy's clown.""

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad
That you're treating me so bad
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses: that's for sure
I die each time
I hear this sound:
""Here he comes.
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown."""
4,Johnny Preston,Running Bear,"On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear: young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid

Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So their love could never be

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side

In the moonlight: he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her Indian brave

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came

As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together
In their happy hunting ground

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die"

Teen Angel
Wooh

That fateful night: the car was stalled
Upon the railroad tracks
I pulled you out and we were safe
But you went running back

Teen Angel: can you hear me?
Teen Angel: can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above
And am I still your own true love?

What was it you were looking for
That took your life that night?
They said they found my high school ring
Clutched in your fingers tight

Teen Angel: can you hear me?
Teen Angel: can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above
And am I still your own true love?

Just sweet sixteen and now you're gone
They've taken you away
I'll never kiss your lips again
They buried you today

Teen Angel: can you hear me?
Teen Angel: can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above
And am I still your own true love?

Teen Angel

Answer me: please"
6,Brenda Lee,I'm Sorry,"I'm sorry: so sorry
That I was such a fool
I didn't know
Love could be so cruel
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yes

You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that don't right
The wrong that's been done

(I'm sorry) I'm sorry
(So sorry) So sorry
Please accept my apology
But love is blind
And I was too blind to see

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yes

You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that don't right
The wrong that's been done
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yes

I'm sorry: so sorry
Please accept my apology
But love was blind
And I was too blind to see

7,Elvis Presley,It's Now Or Never,"It's now or never: come hold me tight 
Kiss me my darling: be mine tonight 
Tomorrow will be too late 
It's now or never: my love won't wait

When I first saw you with your smile so tender 
My heart was captured: my soul surrendered 
I spent a lifetime waiting for the right time 
Now that you're near: the time is here: at last

It's now or never: come hold me tight 
Kiss me my darling: be mine tonight 
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never: my love won't wait

Just like a willow: we would cry an ocean 
If we lost true love and sweet devotion 
Your lips excite me: let your arms invite me 
For who knows when we'll meet again this way 

It's now or never: come hold me tight 
Kiss me my darling: be mine tonight 
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never: my love won't wait

It's now or never: my love won't wait
It's now or never: my love won't wait

It's now or never: my love won't wait"

11,Connie Francis,Everybody's Somebody's Fool,"The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes: everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool at least I know the score
Yet darlin' I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts but I come runnin' back for more

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes: everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue
You'll know how much this heart of mine is breaking
You'll cry for her the way I've cried for you

Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes: everybody's somebody's fool"

15,Marty Robbins,El Paso,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love: but in vain: I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring: a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina: the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one: it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting: I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary: unable to ride

But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina: goodbye"
16,Hollywood Argyles,Alley Oop,
17,Connie Francis,My Heart Has A Mind Of Its Own,"I told this heart of mine
Our love could never be
But then I hear your voice
And something stirs inside of me

Somehow I can't dismiss
The memory of your kiss
Guess my heart has a mind of its own

No matter what I do
No matter what I say
No matter how I try
I just can't turn the other way

When I'm with someone new
I always think of you
Guess my heart has a mind of its own

You're not in love with me
So why can't I forget?
I'm just your ""used-to-be""
It's wrong and yet

I know forgetting you
Would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I
Just can't seem to break the string

I say I'll let you go
But then my heart says no
Guess my heart has a mine of its own
Guess my heart has a mind of its own"

21,Dion and The Belmonts,Where Or When,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when
Some things that happen for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where or when"

28,Johnny Horton,Sink The Bismark,"In May of 1941 the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ships that had the biggest guns
The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And ev'ry British seaman he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark: the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day
The Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people put ev'ry ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismark to the bottom of the sea

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismark made its run
The Admiral of the British fleet said turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark: they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
Sink the Bismark was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
We found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down

We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
We found the mighty Bismark and then we cut her down"

I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever

I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you'll love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me

32,Bobby Darin,Beyond The Sea,"Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waitin' for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailin'

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watchin' for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms: I'd go sailin'

It's far beyond a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailin'

I know beyond a doubt: ah!
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet: I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailin'

No more sailin'
So long: sailin'
Bye bye: sailin'
Move on out: captain"

35,Jack Scott,Burning Bridges,"Found some letters you wrote me this morning
They told of the love we once knew
Now they're gone I burned them to ashes
Don't want nothing to remind me of you

Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow

Sold the house we once planned together
Said goodbye to the folks we once knew
Then I moved to a far away city
Tried so hard to forget about you

Burning bridges behind me
It's too late to turn back now
Burning bridges behind me
All I want is to forget you somehow"

Needles and pins: twilight till dawn
Watching that clock till you return
Lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins: day after day
This is my night: ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say
""Love will appear and this time to stay""

Oh: each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
This time the big hurt will end

Now it begins: now that you've gone
Needles and pins: twilight till dawn
But if you go: come back again
I wonder when: oh when will it end?
The big hurt

The big hurt
The big hurt"

With tender looks that I mistook for love

So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of

Paper roses: paper roses
Oh: how real those roses seemed to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me

I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start

But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart

Paper roses: paper roses
Oh: how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
Like your imitation love for me"
42,Larry Verne,Mr. Custer,"That famous day in history the men of the 7th Cavalry went riding on
And from the rear a voice was heard
A brave young man with a trembling word rang loud and clear
What am I doin' here?

Please Mr. Custer: I don't wanna go
Hey: Mr. Custer: please don't make me go
I had a dream last night about the comin' fight
Somebody yelled ""attack!""
And there I stood with a arrow in my back.

Please Mr. Custer: I don't wanna go
(Forward ho!)
Aww

Look at them bushes out there
They're moving and there's a Injun behind every one
Hey: Mr. Custer: you mind if I be excused the rest of the afternoon?
Hey Charlie: duck yer head!
Hmm: you're a little bit late on that one: Charlie
Hooh: I bet that smarts!

They were sure of victory: the men of the 7th Cavalry: as they rode on
But then from the rear a voice was heard
That same brave voice with the trembling word rang loud and clear
What am I doin' here?

Please Mr. Custer: I don't wanna go
Listen: Mr. Custer: please don't make me go
There's a redskin a'waitin' out there: just fixin to take my hair
A coward I've been called 'cause I don't wanna wind up dead or bald

Please Mr. Custer: I don't wanna go 
(Forward ho!)
Aww

I wonder what the Injun word for friend is
Let's see: friend
Kemo sabe: that's it
Kemo sabe! Hey out there: kemo sabe!
Nope: that itn't it

When the wind blows: mmm

Well: Jack be nimble: Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candlestick
He jumped so high up above
He landed in the cradle of love

Hi diddle diddle: the cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon
And on the way down she met a turtle dove
Said ""Let's go rockin' in the cradle of love""

Jack and Jill went up the hill
To get a pail of water
Jack fell for Jill: gave her a shove
They fell into the cradle of love"

I've been waiting here tonight but not alone
You broke the date that we had made just yesterday
Now there's someone else who's here: he'll have to stay

I have found another love I know is true
And he holds me much more tenderly than you
Loving you's not worth the price I have to pay
Someone else is in your place: he'll have to stay

Once I loved you with all my heart
But now I must say no
You broke my heart too many times
So now you'll have to go

I can hear the jukebox playing soft and low
And you're out again with someone else: I know
My love was blind: I'm not your kind that's all I'll say
So you can hang up: I'm in his arms: he'll have to stay

In time we'll forget
Each others' lies

A million to one

Met a little girl about as cute as she could be
I turned on my charms and told her that I loved her
I said that she would always be the number one for me
She'd always be my number one girl
I said there'd be no number two or three

Down in the malt shop shortly thereafter
Met another girl about as cute as she could be
I looked for number one and when I didn't see her
I told number two she was the only girl for me

Went to the drug store and nearly lost my life
There I saw my girlfriends: one and two
Standing there together: I knew I was in trouble
But I'm a clever guy I knew what to do

I went on down by the station early in the morning
I was wooing women as cute as they could be
But then I saw another girl lookin' kinda pretty
I said I'm through with one and two
I love you number three
I said I love you number three
And here's what she said to me

Just head on down by the station early in the morning
Catch yourself a trolley car that goes into the sea
I want a love that's true sir: not a love like you sir
You weren't true to one and two
You won't be true to me

Down by the station early in the morning
See the little puffer-bellies all in a row
See the station master pull the little handle

He wanted to give her everything
Flowers: presents: but most of all: a wedding ring

He saw a sign for a stock car race
A thousand dollar prize it read
He couldn't get Laura on the phone
So to her mother: Tommy said

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do: that cannot wait

He drove his car to the racing grounds
He was the youngest driver there
The crowed roared as they started the race
Around the track they drove at a deadly pace

No one knows what happened that day
Or how his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath: they heard him say

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

Now in the chapel where Laura prays 
For her poor Tommy: who passed away
It was just for Laura he lived and died
Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry"

Safe in the glow of your love
Sent from the heavens above
Nothing can ever replace
The warmth of your tender embrace

Until the day that we're together once more"

You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart: to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad

Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you

Remember how you used to feel dear
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad

So sad to watch good love go bad"
71,Brenda Lee,That's All You Gotta Do,"Anytime you're feeling low
And you got no place to go
You don't have to be blue
Here's all you gotta do

Call me on the telephone
Tell me that you're all alone
And I'll come a runnin' to you
Baby that's all you gotta do

All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can

I'll love and squeeze you uh huh huh
I'll try to please you
Cause baby I want you to be my lovin' man

I've been waiting for the chance
Needing you to start a romance
And if you feel the same way too
Here's all you gotta do

Tell me just a how you feel
Tell me that your love is real
And I'll give my heart to you
Baby that's all you gotta do

All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can

I'll love and squeeze you uh huh huh
I'll try to please you
Cause baby I want you to be my lovin' man

I've been waiting for the chance
Needing you to start a romance
And if you feel the same way too
Here's all you gotta do

Tell me just a how you feel
Tell me that your love is real
And I'll give my heart to you
Baby that's all you gotta do"
72,Fats Domino,Walking To New Orleans,"It's time I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans

I've got my suitcase in my hand
Now: ain't that a shame
I'm leavin' here today
Yes: I'm goin' back home to stay
Yes: I'm walkin' to New Orleans

You used to be my honey
Till you spent all my money
No use for you to cry
I'll see you bye and bye
'Cause I'm walkin' to New Orleans

I've got no time for talkin'
I've got to keep on walkin'
New Orleans is my home
That's the reason why I'm goin'

73,Connie Francis,Among My Souvenirs,"There's nothing left for me
Of days that used to be
They're just a memory
Among my souvenirs
Some letters sad and blue
A photograph or two
I see a rose from you
Among my souvenirs
A few more tokens rest
Within my treasure chest
And: though they do their best
To give me consolation:
I count them all apart
And: as the teardrops start:
I find a broken heart
Among my souvenirs
I count them all apart
And: as the teardrops start:
I find a broken heart
Among my souvenirs"

77,Paul Anka,My Home Town,"I took a little trip to my home town
I only stopped just to look around
And as I walked along the thorough-fare
There was music playing everywhere

The music came from within my heart
How did it happen how did it start
I only know that I fell in love
I guess the answer lies up above

Oh what a feeling
My heart was reeling
The bells were ringing
The birds were singing

And so the music keep goes on and on
And through the night until the break of dawn
I hear a bird up in the tree
I hear him sing this melody

And so he sings
Ya-ya-ya-ya...

Oh what a feeling
My heart was reeling
The bells were ringing
The birds were singing

And so the music keep goes on and on
And through the night until the break of dawn
And every evening when the sun goes down
I'm with my love in my home town

And so I sing
Ya-ya-ya-ya..."

Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

I'm say Georgia: Georgia
A song of you (a song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

I said Georgia: oh Georgia
No peace I find (peace I find)
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind (Georgia on my mind)

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

And step by step it wasn't hard to do
Kiss by kiss and hand in hand
That's the way it all began
Soon we found the perfect plan for love
Side by side we took a lovers walk
Word by word we had a lover's talk
One word led to another and then
Then in no time we're up to ten
My heart knew it was gonna end in love

1st step: a sweet hello
2nd step: my heart's aglow
3rd step: we had a date
4th step: we stayed up late
5th step: I walk you home
6th step: we're all alone
7th step: we took a chance
One kiss and true romance

Step by step we climbed to heaven's door
Step by step: each thrill invited more
Then you promised faithfully
All your love belonged to me
Now I know we'll always be in love

For it's a wold where love and confusion reign
A world of hope and laughter and tears and pain
At times a gentle breezed and a hurricane
A world full of doubt but love works it out

Young emotions and strange emotions
For though we're brave sometimes we are so afraid
But knowing there are memories to be made
We'll face each new tomarrow dear undismayed
For our love will keep us together
And our love will help us to weather
These young emotions
