1,Gordon Jenkins and The Weavers,Goodnight Irene,"Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take another stroll in town

Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump in the river and drown

Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Stop ramblin'
Stop your gamblin'
Stop stayin' out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by your fireside bright

Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams"
2,Nat King Cole,Mona Lisa,"Mona Lisa: Mona Lisa: men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover: Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

Are you warm: are you real: Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Do you smile to tempt a lover: Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

Are you warm: are you real: Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Mona Lisa: Mona Lisa"

9,Sammy Kaye,Harbor Lights,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me

I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting?
Goodbye to tender nights
Beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But I was on the ship
And you were on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near
And kiss you just once more
But I was on the ship
And you were on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights
Will steal your love from me"
10,Sammy Kaye and Don Cornell,It Isn't Fair,"It isn't fair

It isn't fair for you to taunt me.
How can you make me care this way?
It isn't fair for you to want me
If it's just for a day.

It isn't fair for you to thrill me.
Why do you do the things you do?
It isn't fair for you to fill me
With those dreams that can't come true: dear.

Why is it that you came into my life
And made it complete?
You gave me just a touch of high life;
If this is love then I repeat

It isn't fair for you to taunt me.
How can you make me care this way?
It isn't fair for you to want me
If it's just for today.

Why is it that you came into my life
And made it complete?
You gave me just a touch of high life;
If this is love then I repeat

It isn't fair for you to taunt me.
How can you make me care this way?
It isn't fair for you to want me
If it's just for today."
11,Eileen Barton,If I Knew You Were Coming I'd've Baked A Cake,
12,Kay Starr,Bonaparte's Retreat,"Met the man I love
In a town way down in Dixie
'Neath the stars above
He was the sweetest man you ever did see

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

All the world was bright
When he held me on that night
And I heard him say
""Please don't ever go away""

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

All the world was bright
When he held me on that night
And I heard him say
""Please don't you go away""

He's gone and I'll admit I knew
That I had met my waterloo
I knew that he would say a do
With Bonaparte's retreat

Goodbye little boy
Goodbye little Joy
Goodbye little boy
So long little Joy
Goodbye little boy"
13,Gordon Jenkins and The Weavers,"Tzena, Tzena, Tzena",
14,Tony Martin,There's No Tomorrow,"There's no tomorrow when love is new
Now is forever when love is true
So kiss me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow: there's just tonight

Love is a flower that blooms so tender
Each kiss a dew drop of sweet surrender
Love is a moment of life enchanting
Let's take that moment: that tonight is granting

There's no tomorrow when love is new
Now is forever when love is true
So kiss me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow: there's just tonight"
15,Phil Harris,The Thing,"While I was walking down the beach one bright and sunny day
I saw a great big wooden box a-floatin' in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up and much to my surprise
Ooh: I discovered a (*boom-boom-boom*) right before my eyes
Ooh: I discovered a (*boom-boom-boom*) right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most any thing
But this is what he hollered at me as I walked in his shop
Ooh: get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) before I call a cop
Ooh: get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) before I call a cop

I turned around and got right out: a-runnin' for my life
And than I took it home with me to give it to my wife
But this is what she hollered at me as I walked in the door
Oh: get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and don't come back no more
Oh: get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and don't come back no more

I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was looking for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing: he was a desperate man
But when I showed him the (*boom-boom-boom*): he turned around and ran
Oh: when I showed him the (*boom-boom-boom*): he turned around and ran

I wandered on for many years: a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon St. Peter at the gate
And when I tried to take it inside: he told me where to go
Get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and take it down below
Oh: get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and take it down below

The moral of this story is if you're out on the beach
And you should see a great big box and it's within your reach
Don't ever stop and open it up: that's my advice to you
'Cause you'll never get rid of the (*boom-boom-boom*): no matter what you do
Oh: you'll never get rid of the (*boom-boom-boom*): no matter what you do

(*boom-boom-boom* = 3 strikes on the drum)"
16,Ames Brothers,Sentimental Me,"Sentimental me
Guess I'll always be
So in love with you
Don't know what to do
Sentimental me

Dreaming while I live
Living just to give
All my love to you
No one else will do
Sentimental me

Reaching for the moon
And wishing on a star
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are

Darling: can't you see
It was meant to be?
I'm in love with you
Say you love me: too
Sentimental me

Reaching for the moon (reaching for the moon)
And wishing on a star (wishing on a star)
On my honeymoon (on my honeymoon)
I want to be where you are

Darling: can't you see

I'm in love with you
Say you love me: too

By Andrews Sisters

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

Until I tingle!
(Ah)
I wanna be kissed:
(Ah)
Starting tonight!

Embrace until
Our heartbeats intermingle:

I'm in no mood to resist:
And I insist the world owes me a loving!
(Ooh)

I wanna be thrilled
(Ooh)
To desperation!

18,Patti Page,Tennessee Waltz,"I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes: I lost my little darling the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz

I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes: I lost my little darling the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz"
19,Andrews Sisters and Gordon Jenkins,"I Can Dream, Can't I",
20,Tennessee Ernie Ford and Kay Starr,I'll Never Be Free,"Each time I hold someone new
My arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darling in my embrace
I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
No one can satisfy this longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free"
21,Patti Page,All My Love,"All my love: I give you all my love
The skies may fall: my love
But I will still be true
All my sighs: will disappear at last
Now that you're here at last
My heart belongs to you

Oh ooh: never let me go
You thrill me so
I can see as I recall my life
I've waited all my life
To give you all my love

Ay: ay: ay
Ay: ay: ay
Ay: ay: ay
Ay: ay: ay

Bow: caballero: and tip your sombrero
To your se&#xF1;orita: the lovely Chiquita
Waiting so long for you and your song
While you are playing her heart will be swaying

She will surrender her kisses so tender
To you she will cling the moment that you sing

All my love: I give you all my love
The skies may fall: my love
But I will still be true
All my sighs will disappear at last
Now that you're here at last my heart belongs to you

Oh ooh: never let me go
You thrill me so
I can see as I recall my life
I've waited all my life
To give you all my love

Ay: ay: ay
Ay: ay: ay

I hear a polka an' my troubles are through!
Hoop dee doo: hoop dee dee:
This kind of music is like heaven to me!

Hoop dee doo: hoop dee doo:
It's got me higher than a kite:
Hand me down my soup an' fish
I am gonna get my wish: hoop dee doin' it tonight!

When there's a trombone playin'
I get a thrill: I always will!
When there's a concertina: stretched about a mile:
I always smile: 'cause that's my style!

When there's a fiddle in the middle
Oh! it really is a riddle: how he plays a tune so sweet!
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die:
Lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more
'Cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy!

Hoop dee doo (Hoop dee doo!) hoop dee doo (Hoop dee doo!)
I hear a polka an' my troubles are through! (Ha: ha: ha ha!)
Hoop dee doo (Hoop dee doo!) hoop dee dee (Hoop dee dee!)

I always smile (You'll see him smile!) 'cause that's my style! ('Cause that's his style!)

When there's a fiddle in the middle
Oh! it really is a riddle: how he plays a tune so sweet!
Plays a tune so sweet that we could die!
Oh yes! ... lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more
'Cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy!

Hoop dee doo: hoop dee doo:
It's got us higher than a kite:
We're in clover: we're in bloom
When we're dancin' give us room
Hoop dee doin' it with all of our might:
Rain may fall an' snow may come
Nothin's gonna stop us from
Hoop dee doin' it: hoop dee doin' it:
Hoop dee doin' it ... tonight!

26,Gordon Jenkins,Bewitched,
27,Ames Brothers,Can Anyone Explain?,
28,Billy Eckstine,My Foolish Heart,"The night is like a lovely tune: beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon: take care: my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine: beware my foolish heart

But should our eager lips combine: then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination: or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time: it's love: my foolish heart"
29,Bing Crosby,Dear Hearts And Gentle People,"I love those dear hearts and gentle people
Who live in my home town
Because those dear hearts and gentle people
Will never ever let you down

They read the good book
From fri till Monday
That's how the weekend goes
I've got a dream house
I'll build there one day
With picket fence and ramblin rows

I feel so welcome each time I return
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
I love the dear hearts and gentle people
Who live and love in my home town

There's a place I'd like to go
And it's back in idaho
Where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello
It's a pleasure and a treat
To meandor down the street
That's why I want the whole wide world to know
I love those dear hearts
I love the gentle people
(Who live in my home town)
Because those dear hearts and gentle people
Will never ever let you down

They read the good book
From fri till Monday
That's how the weekend goes
I've got a dream house
I'll build there one day
With picket fence and ramblin rows

I feel so welcome each time I return
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
I love the dear hearts and gentle people
Who live and love in my home town

(Home home sweet home
Home home sweet home)
Home home sweet home
Home home sweet home"
30,Frankie Laine,Cry Of The Wild Goose,"My heart knows what the wild goose knows:
I must go where the wild goose goes.
Wild goose: brother goose: which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest? 

Tonight I heard the wild goose cry:
Wingin' north in the lonely sky.
Tried to sleep: it weren't no use:
'Cause I am a brother to the old wild goose: 

(Oh: my heart knows what the wild goose knows:)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
(Wild goose: brother goose: which is best?)
(A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?) 

Woman was kind and true to me.
She thinks she loves me: the more fool she.
She's got a love that ain't no use:
To love a brother of the old wild goose. 

(My heart knows what the wild goose knows:)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
(Wild goose: brother goose: which is best?)
(A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?)
(Oh: you wild goose.) 

The cabin is warm and the snow is deep:
I got a woman who lies asleep.
She'll wake at tomorrow's dawn:
She'll find: poor critter: that her man is gone.
(Oh: you wild goose.) 

My heart knows what the wild goose knows:
I must go where the wild goose goes.
Wild goose: brother goose: which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?
Let me fly: let me fly: let me fly away. 

Spring is comin' and the ice will break:
I can't linger for a woman's sake.
She'll see a shadow pass overhead.
She'll find my feathers beside my bed. 

(My heart knows what the wild goose knows:)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
Wild goose: brother goose: which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest? 

(Wild goose: wild goose: wild goose: wild goose.)"
