1,Boyz II Men,End Of The Road,"Spoken:
Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby: you just see

We belong together and you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart: why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever: said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head: oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' it 'round and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural: you belong to me: I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural: you belong to me: I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me: you just don't realize
You've never been there before: it's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you: maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever: you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead: just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me: don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (can't let go: baby)
It's unnatural: you belong to me: I belong to you

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm going to do)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God: oh my God)
It's unnatural: you belong to me: I belong to you

Spoken:
Girl: I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it: I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out and cheat at night: just like you did baby
But that's alright: (Huh) I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you till my dying day baby
Right now: I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you just come back to me
(Lonely) Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts baby
(Lonely) I feel pain too
Baby please

This time instead: just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Although we've come: to the end of the road  (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go: no: no no)
It's unnatural (No no no no no no) you belong to me
I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come: (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road: the end of the road)
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Oh my God: oh my god: help me out of this baby)
It's unnatural: you belong to me: I belong to you

Although we've come: to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Alright: alright alright)
It's unnatural (It's unnatural): you belong to me (You belong to me)
I belong to you (I belong to you: whoa)

Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go: no: no no)
It's unnatural (No no no no no no): you belong to me: I belong to you"
2,Sir Mix-a-Lot,Baby Got Back,"Oh my God: Becky: look at her butt
It is so big
She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends
But: you know:
Who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute: okay?

I mean her butt
It's just so big
I can't believe it's just so round
It's like out there
I mean: gross
Look: she's just so... black!

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung

Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed?
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh: baby: I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes m-m-me so horny

Ooh: rump of smooth skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz
Well use me: use me: 'cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen them dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat: wet: got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that

She gotta pack much back: so...
Fellas (yeah): fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell them to shake it (shake it): shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back

(L.A. face with an Oakland booty)
Baby got back
(L.A. face with an Oakland booty)

I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself
I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And uh: double-up: uh: uh

I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble

So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

A word to the thick soul sistas
I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *breathing*
Till the break of dawn

Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on

So ladies (yeah): ladies (yeah)
If you wanna role in my Mercedes? (yeah)
Then turn around: stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
""Baby got back!""

Baby got back
Yeah: baby
When it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection
36-24-36 ha ha
Only if she's 5'3""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns: hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups but please don't lose that butt

Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it: Miss Thing!
Give me a sister: I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

So ladies if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT and kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back"

4,Vanessa Williams,Save The Best For Last,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

La la la la la la la
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last
Yeah: yeah"

6,Eric Clapton,Tears In Heaven,"Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?

I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?

I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you beggin' please: beggin' please

Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you be the same
If I saw you in heaven?

I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven"

8,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Under The Bridge,"Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in: the city of angels
Lonely as I am: together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well: I never worry: now that is a lie

And I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love: take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love: take me all the way

It's hard to believe that I'm all alone

Take me to the place I love: take me all the way

11,Shanice,I Love Your Smile,"Sittin' in my class: just driftin' away
Starin' into the windows of the world: yeah
I can't hear the teacher: his books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play

'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile

The clock at work says: ""Three""
And I wanna be free
Free to scream: free to bathe: free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know: and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

'Cause I love your smile
Hey said: ""I love your smile""

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know: I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig

I'm showin'
The life that I'm livin'
This is the life that I have
And it's given to you
Yeah and it's true
La-d-da
Twinkley D
Do you?

Believe in a girl
Like me
Shanice is the one
For you to be with
But when I'm caught
All alone
I start fessin'
It's from a state of depression

And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder ""do you still love me?
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world

I do: I love smile
Yes I do boy
I love the smile
I love your smile: baby
I love your smile
I really do"

I can make you start to smile

When it's through: it's through
Fate could twist the both of you
So come on: baby: come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside: I hope you'll feel it too (feel it: too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (waited on a line)
Yeah: just to be the next to be with you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)

MICHAEL
Ow!
Ow!

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy: is that girl with you?
Yes: we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight!
Hee!
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true: either you're wrong or you're right!
Ooh!
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hee!
Don't compare!
Hee hee!

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sewn when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Sewn: when the goin' gets mean

RAP SINGER
Protection
For gangs: clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war
On a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See: it's not about races:
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

MICHAEL
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee hee!
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright: alright: oh
Ooh: ooh
Alright
Yeah yeah yeah: now
Alright: alright
Ooh ooh
Sh'mon: now

Whoo!
It's black: it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black: it's white
Whoo!"
15,Billy Ray Cyrus,Achy Breaky Heart,"You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Oh: you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been 
And laugh and joke about me on the phone

You can tell my arms: go back onto the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips 
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff: his fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway

Or tell your aunt Louise: tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind 
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Ooh

But don't tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

But don't tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart: my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

17,Guns N' Roses,November Rain,"When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darling: when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same: yeah

Nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long: long time
Just trying to kill the pain: ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's letting go today: walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine: all mine

So if you want to love me
Then darling: don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walking
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh: everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh: don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?

Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh: everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh: don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain: ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So nevermind the darkness
We still can find a way
Nothing lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody"
18,Tom Cochrane,Life Is A Highway,"Love's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend: sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
Break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I loved you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hills
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down: back up again
You're in my blood; I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough; this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (gimme: gimme: gimme: gimme: yeah!)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye (oh!)

There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough: this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (gimme: gimme: gimme: gimme: yeah!)
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (gimme: gimme: gimme: gimme: yeah!)
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (gimme: gimme: gimme: gimme: yeah!)"
19,Michael Jackson,Remember The Time,"Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end
Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes: we'd stare

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met: girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember how we used to talk: ya know
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said 
Like I love you so: I'll never let you go
Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning: birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met: girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And: girl: no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had: now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met: girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Remember: my baby!
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Remember the time: remember the time (do you remember girl)
Remember the time (on the phone: you and me): remember the time (till dawn: two or three)
(What about us: girl) remember the time (do you: do you: do you: do you: do you)
Remember the time (In the park: on the beach)
Remember the time: remember the time (you and me in Spain)
(What about: what about) remember the time (Ooh: in the park)
Remember the time (after dark: do you: do you: do you)
Remember the time (do you: do you: do you: do you)
Remember the time (yeah: yeah): remember the time"

21,Madonna,This Used To Be My Playground,"This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

Don't look back: keep your head held high
Don't ask them why: because life is short
And before you know: you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well: that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

No regrets
But I wish that you were here with me
Well then: there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy

This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me

This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me"
22,Patty Smyth and Don Henley,Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,"Now: I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby: sometimes love just ain't enough

Now: I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby: you don't have to take the fall
Yes: I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby: sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby: sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby: sometimes love: it just ain't enough"
23,Mariah Carey,Can't Let Go,"Can't let go ooh baby

There you are holding her hand 
I am lost dying to understand 
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know you were my life?

Even though I try I can't let go 
Something in your eyes captured my soul 
And every night I see you in my dreams 
You're all I know I can't let go 

Just cast aside you don't even know I'm alive 
You just walk on by don't care to see me cry  
Here I am still holding on 
I can't accept my world is gone: no: no

Even though I try I can't let go 
Something in your eyes captured my soul 
And every night I see you in my dreams 
You're all I know I can't let go 

Do you even realize the sorrow
I have inside every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny
That I need you but still you remain on my mind 

(Even though I try I can't let go)
No I just can't get you out of my mind
(Something in your eyes captured my soul)
I never can say goodbye 
And every night
(And every night I see you in my dreams)
(You're all I know I can't let go)
You're all I know I can't let you go 

(Even though I try I can't let go) 
Even though I try
(Something in your eyes captured my soul)
I can't let go of something that I need so badly
(And every night I see you in my dreams)

I came to win
Battle me: that's a sin

Punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up

Get up: stand up (come on!)
Come on: throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling
Jump up touch the ceiling

Muggs lifts a funk flow
Someone's talking junk: yo
I'll bust him in the eye
And then I'll take the punk's hoe

Feelin': funkin'
Amps in the trunk: and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down

Word to your moms
I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms

And just like the Prodigal Son: I've returned
Anyone stepping on me - you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun (shotgun)

But if you do you're a fool: 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me - you'll take your last breath
I got the skill: come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give: I shoot to kill

I'm the cream of the crop: I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out as if my name was Sega

But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around: then buck buck get down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn Of The Dead

I'm coming to get ya: I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics: homie I'll wet ya

26,George Michael and Elton John,Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,"I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Although I search myself: it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find: oh: the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me: just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have: oh they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Although I search myself: it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Although I search myself: it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free: yeah
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me"

And everything is right.
The gentle way you look at me:
When we kiss goodnight.
You've given me the freedom no other love has known
And now I thank you girl: thank you girl

The countless ways you've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away
A picture perfect painting: that's what our love is
And yes I need you so: and now I know

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

Sometimes I wonder what I'd be
Had I not found you
A lost and lonely soul this world
Could show me nothing new

But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be
And now I see

The two of us together
Through time will never part
This fairy tale we sharing
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise I do make
Heaven is ours to take

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

When I'm lost and insecure
You build me up and make me sure
That everything will turn out right
My love

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true

I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling: darlin': since I've found you
That I've found my home: that I'm finally home

I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me: darlin'
I said I needed: needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to
If you

Asked me to: I will give my world to you: baby
I need you now (I need you now)
Asked me to: I'll do anything (Anything) for you: baby
For you baby

(If you asked me to)
I'd let you in my life forever
(If you asked me to)
All you gotta do is ask me to
All you gotta do: all you gotta do
All you gotta do is ask me to

(If you asked me to)
I will give my world
Everything: everything: baby!

(If you asked me to)
I couldn't ask what you do to me
If you asked me to

(If you asked me to)"
29,En Vogue,Giving Him Something He Can Feel,"(Shoo)
Many say
That I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from.
But you will see
It's just a matter of time
My love surely make you mine

Well: I'm
Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone Seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong: it's all right: my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on
With my man
People out there can you understand

I'm givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

So much joy for us it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
(Hey: oh yeah)
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true.
You tell me 'what does it mean'.

Well: I'm
Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone Seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong: it's all right: my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on
With my man
People out there can you understand

I'm givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real"
30,Joe Public,Live And Learn,"You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies
A lot of people ask the questions why
Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em: Joe)

I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Ah: yeah
Y'all: check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down

There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see
I know there's still a possibility
You raise a little kid: he turns out bold
It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)

I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

(Large) If large is how ya livin'
Why you're livin' large: are you takin' what is given
To you: in the form of true experience
'Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'

And this is from the J: the O: and the E

Mary: Mary: Mary: it's quite contrary
Yo': how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school: you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail
Now on the other hand: there's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

You've got to live and learn

You've got to live and learn

Got my eyes on you
I've been watching you
For so very long
Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really want to meet you
But I'm kind of scared
'Cause you're the kind of lady
With so much class
Get my thoughts together
For the very next day
But when I see you lady
I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair
Such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk
It really turns me on
Ooh you really turn me on
Come on come on come on

There you are again
With the same smile each day
I wanna know what it is that makes me feel this way
I wish I could grab you
Tell you what it means to me
To see you walking by my way
It really makes my day
Before I go to sleep and dream about you
I'm a single man
I hope that you are single too
Why do I seek
Something to set my mind free
'Cause curiosity is buggin' the hell outta me
Talk to me: talk to me: talk to me: baby

Come and talk to me
I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you

You ain't got no trustin' about you

And you claim that you
Don't care where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why ya callin' all around
Think I've got some dip on the side

Girl you don't trust no one
And you constantly in doubt
You lose the game
If you play that way

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

When you love someone
And you want to love 'em right

That you're holdin' on too tight
Soon they will be leavin' without you

Say that you love someone

Give you everything you need to live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn: I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Made sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything: tonight: I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind: and you won't feel ashamed

Open up on the inside
Gonna fill you up: gonna make you cry

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you come inside my jungle book
Or is it just too good?
Don't say you'll stay: 'cause then you go away

Damn: I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Made sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything: tonight: I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind: and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks: for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn: I wish I was your lover (oh: yeah)

If I was your girl: believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better (guess what)
Come: let me in: mm
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through Heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in: oh
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

I sat on a mountainside with peace of mind
And I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn: I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Made sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything: tonight: I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind: and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks: for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it

I wanna open up: I'm gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up: I wanna make you cry

Damn: I wish I was your lover
Gettin' on a subway: and I'm comin' uptown

Damn: I wish I was your lover
Standing on the street corner: waiting for my love to change

Damn: I wish I was your lover
And I'm feelin' like a school boy: too shy and too young: oh

Damn: I wish I was your lover
I wanna open up: I'm gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up: I wanna make you cry

Damn: I wish I was your lover
I'm gettin' on my camel: and I'll ride it uptown: ooh

Damn: I wish I was your lover

To what we had
The good times that made us laugh
Outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday"

40,Arrested Development,Tennessee,"Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out: losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic

Brothers and sisters keep messing up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull

My grandma's passed: my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)

But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way

Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me

Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)

Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree: my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)

Make me forget all that hurts me

A game of horseshoes!

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games

I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...

The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for
Are the answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place (Home)
Take me to another land (Home)

Won't you help me
Won't you help me understand you plan?

Now that I've discovered what you mean to me (What you mean to me)
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other the best things in life are free

Don't you know: don't you know
The very best in life is free
And I'm free: yeah"
42,Mariah Carey,Make It Happen,"Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid

No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on

You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I have to keep going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord

If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it happen
(Make it happen)

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)"
43,Elton John,The One,"I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Babe: you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer yield

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe: you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe: you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe: you're the one"
44,P.M. Dawn,Set Adrift On Memory Bliss,"Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans to a cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing

I think its one of those d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu things
Or a dream that's trying to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinking about it
I don't know: I doubt it

Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Misses Princess who?

Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone: solitaire

I can remember when I caught up
With a past-time intimate friend: she said
""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me.""

She was right: though: I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes: I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring

An eye for an eye: a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole: it doesn't have meaning

Reality used to be a friend of mine
Caused complete control: I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate: you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone

She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do
I feel for her: I really do

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes: I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you"
45,Shakespear's Sister,Stay,"If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go alone
Don't think I'll understand

Stay with me: stay with me

In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in between
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

Stay with me: stay with me

You'd better hope and pray
That you'll make it safe
Back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you'll wake one day
In your own world

'Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear you cries in your own world
Only time will tell if you can break the spell
Back in your own world

Stay with me: stay with me
Stay with me: stay with me"

Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

Yeah baby: 'cause inside I'd die without you

Oh: I apologize for all the things I've done
But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry
Isn't it amazing how some things just completely turn around
So take every little piece of my heart (piece of my heart
So take every little piece of my soul (every little piece of my soul)
Take every little piece of my mind

As hearing when we lie
The truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I

Is saying everything: everything

To be this close: to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks: I feel it say

Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave I know
And the air outside so soft
Confessing everything: everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close: to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks: I feel it say

And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won't trouble me

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close: to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks: I feel it say

It feels so close (All I want is to feel this way)

Let it hold me so (All I want is to feel this way)

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else

She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend: if he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way: it oughta be: hey

Well: this man loves you: woman: hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby: baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels

When a man loves a woman: oh
When a man loves a woman: yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man: when a man: when a man loves a woman

Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
'That boy's not right'

Three years ago when I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and lies
And saw the man inside

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went a-walking alone
And never came home

Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone: long gone

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town"

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?

At night I dream that she is there

60,U2,One,"Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame

You say one love: one life
When it's one need in the night
One love: we get to share it
It leaves you: baby: if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well: it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one: but we're not the same
We get to carry each other: carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much: more than a lot?
You gave me nothing: now it's all I got
We're one: but we're not the same
Well: we hurt each other then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple: love: a higher law
Love is a temple: love: the higher law
You ask me to enter: but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love: one blood
One life: you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters: brothers

One life: but we're not the same
We get to carry each other: carry each other
One
One

Makin' it: makin' it: makin' it

67,Arrested Development,People Everyday,"See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box: right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype: see?

Outta nowhere comes a woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease

Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the fourty oz: going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene

At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood

So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (Boo!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it

Well I stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why: Lord: do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me

I am everyday people: yeah
See I am everyday people: yeah

I told the niggaz please let us pass: friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't ""Ice Cube""
But I had to take the brother out for being rude

And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

You see
I am everyday people: yeah
You see: I am everyday people"

69,Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch,Wildside,"Ah yeah huh... America the Beautiful
Huh: yeah: let me introduce y'all... to the Wildside

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks: no girl was sweeter
Come Prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas swinging nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it all in stride
'Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making fifty to fifty-five thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life... the last for death
Now she's gone: a former Valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams and shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit - on the Wildside

Ron had enough of being broke everyday
Saying to himself: there's gotta be a better way
'Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make - money
Before you know it: he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW: a condo: Ron ended up a John Doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk - on the Wildside

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job: a good life: a good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an Ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupted and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated 'cause their skin was brown
Then there was Bennett: guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know: sure as as sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol: collect a big check
Blame it on a black man: what the heck?
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is - on the Wildside

Little Tiffany: only thirteen
Came to the city: place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summertime
Sittin' on a mailbox: watchin' the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far: her vacation was top notch
Then out of the blue: a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany: and instantly she died
Innocently - on the Wildside"

Live how they wanna live: play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance: kick and the slap a friend
The Addams Family!

Now I was cold coolin': you know (maxin' and relaxin')
Just kickin' it around the house (oaktown kicking' it)
When a knock: a knock: a knock and a voice yo!
Can Hammer come out? (what's up?)
Now I don't mind (mind) being a friend
And showin' a little bit of flava (flava)
But Wednesday: Pugsley: Gomez: Fester (oh man)
Man: them some strange neighbours

They do what they wanna do: say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live: play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance: kick and the slap a friend
The Addams Family!

I remember the day I needed to borrow
A little of pepper (for my chicken)
The next thing you know: comin' at me
Was a hand with the fingers high steppin' (I'm witcha)
Now I tried to play it along (you know)
And act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha)
But what do I see (yo) a perm with feet (cousin it)
Standin' about three feet tall (I'm outta here)

They do what they wanna do: say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live: play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance: kick and the slap a friend
The Addams Family!

Speakin' and thinkin' about the Addams
You know the Hammer is with it (I'm with it)
Act a fool: no bones: swooop: goofy and randy
You know we kick it (the posse)
Now is the time to get in your mind
It's OK to be yourself (be yourself)
Take foolish pride and put it aside
Like the Addams: yo! they def (that's a family!)

They do what they wanna do: say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live: play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance: kick and the slap a friend

77,Michael Bolton,Missing You Now,"I'll talk to you but it's not the same
As touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you

We'll be together
It won't be long: it won't be long
But it feels like forever
And it's hard to be strong

Baby: 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you: baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now

Wishin' you were here by my side
Is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night
They should be holdin' you

Thought I was stronger
How could I know: how could I know
I can't take this much longer
It's so hard on my soul

Baby: 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
I've gotta be with you: baby
I'm missing you now
Don't know what I'm gonna do
To show the way I'm missing you now

Baby: I just can't wait: till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart: right here in my arms
Then and only then will I be satisfied
Missing you now

I know

We'll be together
It won't be long: it won't be long
But it feels like forever
And it's hard to be strong

Baby: 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you: baby
Can't wait till I'm alone with you

Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh: what the hell: I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night: I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Henny: for me to get bent on
Hit the country club to pick up ML
Eighty West: back to the hotel

At the Telly: Bones is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The Latina on the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me: babydoll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night: so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride: brothers strikin' through to be seen
A Lexus 400 to the triple gold Z's
Acid in my bottle: so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honkey: straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock: jimmy in the glove
Layin' in the Lexus: I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the Telly: I gotta get some ""nuca""

Aw naw: could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up: told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her: so I called TL
Smooth me up: Sally wanted new dick
And Monty licked: so try an' make it real quick

Aw yeah: I jumped in the F-train
But wait a minute: we gotta hit the store: man
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tac's
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods: now we're headed for the hoe down
There goes the Telly: so fella: won't you slow down?
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case we gotta bust a quick one
Locked and loaded: let's go look for: like: one-eighteen
But lay low 'cause I really don't wanna be seen
""Is this the room?""
Aw yeah: that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the light: man: I just might: man
Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung: that she'll drop some ""mail""
So I can cut turf and hit another hotel"

No one understands you more
You fear every step you take
So sure that your heart will break
It's not how the story ends
You'll be back on your feet again

Baby: this time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more goodbyes
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

The pain's still alive in you
For what one man puts you through
You say that we're all the same
But I'm called by no other name
We all need a place to run
Won't you let me be the one

Baby: this time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more goodbyes
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

Don't keep a dream in you locked outside your door
Just believe in this love
And don't be afraid anymore
Come on: come on

I need you to please be strong
I've waited for you too long

Baby: this time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more long nights
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

No more goodbyes

We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to
Satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

Ooh: when I met you I just knew that
You would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me toward some real love

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

I got to have a real love

Loves so true and oh baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to
The question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards
The love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good luvin' through the summer time
Winter: spring: and fall

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'Cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down hey
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you

Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down hey
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you

Yo is it me: is it me or can it be I am a little too friendly

I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me (yeah: yeah)
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me

Remembering how it use to be
Those times are precious: I cherish every moment we spent. Yeah!
Thinkin' back on all the arguments
Thinkin' back way back when
We kissed and made up and all was fair in love

So now we gotta go back baby (maybe we can turn the hands of time)
Going back to when (Going back to when you were mine)
When we were one (remembering the times when we were one: one in love)
When love was fun (oh baby: baby)
Dig it...

Remembering the first time you showed me your love
The feeling was so strong heaven sent from above
But you had no right to play with my heart.
You showed no shame
Time after time and place after place
Night after night and day after day
I'm still missing your love and the feelings we share
Sometimes I cry at night 'cause I feel so all alone.
I need your love right here with me to keep me safe and warm.

(Maybe we can turn the hands of time)
I'm going back to when (going back to when: when you were mine)

90,Charles and Eddie,Would I Lie To You?,
91,Amy Grant,That's What Love Is For,"Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way.

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far.

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it.
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby: that's what love is for.

Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away by emotions
I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find


Believing in the one thing
That has gotten us this far
That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it.
Round off the edges
Talk us down from the ledges
Give us strength to try once more
Baby: that's what love is for

That's what love is for.
That's what love is for
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby: that's what love is for.
That's what love is for.
That's what love is for.
That's what love is for."
92,Richard Marx,Keep Coming Back,"You know just how to hurt me
And how to take all the pain away
Girl: you must be the devil in disguise
There were times: I think you knew
When I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness in your eyes

You know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else can see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me

I don't know why I keep coming back to you: baby
I don't know why I keep coming back to you
To you baby

You say we shouldn't be lovers
And I say we can't just be friends
And all this talking just makes me want you more
You've got a way of confusing a heart
That nobody else could do
Why should I try: I don't want to get over you

I'm so in love: so in love with the games that you play
So in love: and nothing can keep me away

You've got a way of confusing a heart
That nobody else could do
Why should I try: I don't want to get over you

I don't know why I keep coming back to you
Just tell me why I keep coming back to you"
93,En Vogue,Free Your Mind,"Prejudice: wrote a song about it
Like to hear? Here it goes

Free your mind

I wear tight clothing: high heel shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute: no: no
I like rap music: wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope: no: no: no

Oh my: forgive me for having straight hair
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heir: yeah: yeah
I might date another race or color
It doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers

Why: oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me: you gotta learn how to see me

I said
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow

So I'm a sista: buy things with cash
That really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad

So why dispute me and waste my time
Because you really think the price is high for me
I can't look without being watched
You rang my buy before I made up my mind

Now attitude: why even bother
I can't change your mind: can't change my color

Why: oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me: you got to learn how to see me

I said
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow
Free your mind


Why: oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me: you got to learn how to see me

I said
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind: don't be so shallow
Free your mind"
94,Keith Sweat,Keep It Comin',"Kick it one time!

Keep it comin': girl I want you to
Turn me on with all the kissing and hugging
Do me baby: drive me crazy
I can never get enough of your lovin'

Feels so good when I'm with you
You know I gotta have your love
Every day and every night
You're the one I'm thinking of
(You've got all I love)
Everything that I like: oh yes you do
(Let's make love tonight)
All you gotta do is bring your body right here: babe

Keep it comin': girl I want you to
Turn me on with all the kissing and hugging
Do me baby: drive me crazy
I can never get enough of your lovin'

Ooh ooh baby

Kissing you is such a thrill
Take you for a natural high
Can't explain the way it feels
When it goes up deep inside
(Let me hold you tight)
Hold you tight
And have your body all night long: girl
(Give me all you got)
Give me all you got: babe
Don't you ever smile: babe

Keep it comin': girl I want you to

95,Mr. Big,Just Take My Heart,"It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday?
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you: but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go

Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself: I know there's no turning back
Face to face: it's been an endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around
But if this is goodbye

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you: but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go

Just take my heart
Just take my heart when you go
Baby: just take my heart
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you
I'll always love you: but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart
Baby: just take my heart when you go

Take my heart
Just take my heart"
96,Amy Grant,I Will Remember You,"I will be walking one day
Down a street far away
And see a face in the crowd and smile
Knowing how you made me laugh
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past
I will remember you.

Look into my eyes while you're near
Tell me what's happening here
See that I don't want to say good-bye
Our love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember you.

Later on
When this fire is an ember
Later on
When the nights not so tender
Given time
Though it's hard to remember darlin'
I will be holding
I'll still be holding to you
I will remember you.

So many years come and gone
And yet the memory is strong
One word we never could learn
Good-bye
True love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember you
So please remember
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you"

Let's get: let's get: let's get: let's get
Rocked

I'm your average: ordinary: everyday kid
Happy to do nothin'
In fact: that's what I did

I got a million ways to make my day
But daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away he says
He got plans for me

(""Get your butt right out of bed"") Stop buggin' me
(""Get up and move your sleepy head"") Don't shake my tree

He said: (""Mow the lawn"") Who: me?
(""Walk the dog"") Not my style: man
(""Take out the trash"") No way
(""Tidy your room"") C'mon get real

I'm sorry dad: gotta disappear
Let's get the rock outta here

Seven-day weekend: up all night
In at the deep end: hang on tight
Won't take a minute: won't take long
So get on in it: come on: come on: come on

Let's get: let's get: let's get: let's get rocked

C'mon let's get: let's get: let's get: let's get rocked

I'm your average: ordinary: everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby
To get her in the mood

She's dialin' through my radio
And I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll
And it really blew my groove

It was (Chopin: Mozart: Beethoven)
It makes me wanna scream
(Bach: Tchaikovsky: violins)
Turn it off) That ain't my scene

Well: I'm sorry girl: here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?

Seven-day weekend: up all night
In at the deep end: hang on tight
It won't take a minute: it won't take long
So get on in it: come on: come on: come on

Let's go all the way: get it night and day
C'mon let's get: let's get: let's get: let's get rocked: oh

All I wanna do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancin' with this broom

I feel lucky today
Hey: look at that man
Do ya wanna get rocked?
Do ya wanna get rocked?

Oh: it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on: get with it
Oh: c'mon: everybody

100,Bonnie Raitt,I Can't Make You Love Me,"Turn down the lights: turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me: tell me no lies
Just hold me close: don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark: in these final hours
I will lay down my heart: and I'll feel the power
But you won't: no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

I'll close my eyes: then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come: and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark: in these final hours
I will lay down my heart: and I'll feel the power
But you won't: no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't"
