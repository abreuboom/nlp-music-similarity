6,Dean Martin,Everybody Loves Somebody,"Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
Theres no tellin' where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps sayin'
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

(If I had it in my power)
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm

Every boy would find what I found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

7,Mary Wells,My Guy,"Nothing you can say can tear me away
From my guy
Nothing you could do: 'cause I'm stuck like glue
To my guy

I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather we stick together
I'm tellin' you from the start
I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you could do could make me untrue
To my guy  (my guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie
To my guy (my guy)

I gave my guy my word of honor
To be faithful and I'm gonna
You'd best be believing
I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion: I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste to be exact
He's my ideal as a matter of fact

No muscle bound man could take my hand
From my guy (my guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place
Of my guy (my guy)

He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy: we are
There's not a man today who can take me away
From my guy

No muscle bound man (muscle bound man) could take my hand
From my guy (my guy)
No handsome face (handsome face) could ever take the place
Of my guy (my guy)

He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy: we are
There's not a man today who can take me away
From my guy (what'cha say?)
There's not a man today who could take me away
From my guy (Tell me more!)
There's not a man today who could take me away
From my guy (What's that?)
There's not a man today..."
8,Gale Garnett,We'll Sing In The Sunshine,"We'll sing in the sunshine:
We'll laugh every day:
We'll sing in the sunshine:
Then I'll be on my way.

I will never love you:
The cost of love's too dear.
But though I'll never love you:
I'll stay with you one year.

And we can sing in the sunshine:
We'll laugh everyday:
We'll sing in the sunshine:
Then I'll be on my way.

I'll sing to you each morning:
I'll kiss you every night.
But darlin' don't cling to me:
I'll soon be out of sight.

But we can sing in the sunshine:
We'll laugh everyday:
We'll sing in the sunshine:
Then I'll be on my way.

My daddy he once told me:
""Hey: don't you love you any man.
Just take what they may give you:
And give but what you can.""

And you can sing in the sunshine:
You'll laugh everyday:
You'll sing in the sunshine:
Then be on your way.

And when a year has ended:
And I have gone away:
You'll often speak about me:
And this is what you'll say:

We sang in the sunshine:
You know we laughed everyday:
We sang in the sunshine:
Then she went on her way."
9,J. Frank Wilson and The Cavaliers,Last Kiss,"Well where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road straight ahead
A car was stalled the engine was dead
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The crying tires the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Well where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Well when I woke up the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running running my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night
I raised her head and when she smiled and said
Hold me darling for a little while
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night

Well where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Woh: Woh: Woh: Woh
Oh: Oh: Oh: Oh"

11,Barbara Streisand,People,"People
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children: needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world"

27,Gene Pitney,It Hurts To Be In Love,"It hurts to be in love: when the only one you love
Turns out to be someone who's not in love with you.
It hurts to love her so: when deep down inside you know:
She will never want you: no matter what you do.

And so you cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh you die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night: night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

How long can I exist?
Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses: to somebody else.
She thinks I'm just a friend
Though it hurts: I must pretend
The only way to keep her: is to keep it to myself.

And so I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night: night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

And so I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night: night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.

It hurts to be in love: day and night: night and day
It hurts to be in love. night and day: day and night
It hurts to be in love: day and night: night and day..."
28,Jan and Dean,Dead Man's Curve,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag
I said: ""You're on: buddy: my mill's runnin' fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll throw you one better if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way
To Dead Man's Curve""

Dead Man's Curve: it's no place to play
Dead Man's Curve: you best keep away
Dead Man's Curve: I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve!

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat at the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should of heard the whine from my screamin' machine
I flew past La Brea: Schwab's: and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were
At Dead Man's Curve

Dead Man's Curve: it's no place to play
Dead Man's Curve

Well: the last thing I remember: doc: I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve!

Dead Man's Curve: it's no place to play
Dead Man's Curve: you best keep away
Dead Man's Curve: I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve!"
29,Jay and The Americans,Come A Little Bit Closer,"In a little caf&#xE9; just the other side of the border
She was just sitting there giving me looks that made my mouth water
So I started walking her way
She belonged to bad man Jos&#xE9;
And I knew: yes I knew I should leave
When I heard her say

Come a little bit closer: you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer: I'm all alone
And the night is so long

So we started to dance: in my arms she felt so inviting
That I just couldn't resist just one little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say
Vamoose: Jos&#xE9;'s on his way
And I knew: yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say

Come a little bit closer: you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer: I'm all alone
And the night is so long

Then the music stopped: when I looked the caf&#xE9; was empty
Then I heard Jos&#xE9; say: ""Man: you know you're in trouble plenty""
So I dropped my drink from my hand
And through the window I ran
And as I rode away I could hear 
Her say to Jos&#xE9;

Come a little bit closer: you're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer: I'm all alone
And the night is so long"

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love smile
She may come: I know not when
When she does: I'll lose
So baby until then

Lock me away

Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother: tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well: I've got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train

And tore apart our happy home in Memphis: Tennessee

Uh-uh
By the way: where'd you meet him?

I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture? (yes: we see)
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack

My folks were always putting him down (down: down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(Whatcha mean when ya say that he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack

One day my dad said: ""Find someone new""
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
(Whatcha mean when ya say that ya better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you the leader of the pack

He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
But whether he heard: I'll never know

Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out!

I felt so helpless: what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears: but I don't care
I'll never forget him: the leader of the pack

The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone

Whisper secrets to the wind

Send falling stars that seem to cry

It breaks your heart in two
To know she's been untrue
But oh: what will you do?
When she said to you
""There's someone new
We're through: we're through
It's over: it's over: it's over""

All the rainbows in the sky
Start to weep: then say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows anymore

Setting suns before they fall

But you'll see lonely sunsets after all

No matter where I go
The clouds are all the same.
To them I'm just
A pebble in the Sand: a face without a name.

Nobody gives a hang for what I say or do
But you.
And in the shelter of your arms
I find peace and comfort and care.
For I am wanted there.

In this cold world
I struggle to survive
And sometimes I would fall.

You'll think someone
Would lend a helping hand they'd sooner to see me crawl.

Now just when life itself seems more than I can bare: your there.
And in the shelter of your arms:
I find strength and safety in them:
I rise and start again.

Just give me one good reason
To go on living 
To keep on trying.
For what.
I ask you for what.
If not for you and all your love
To see me through.

When times look bad
The shelter of your arms will keep away each fear.
And this cold world
Can never get me down
As long as you are here.

That's why I pray to god
You'll never say goodbye.
And I will know the shelter of your arms
And your love for all of my life.
Until the day I die."

85,Nancy Wilson,(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am,"My love has no beginning: my love has no end 
No front or back and my love won't bend 
I'm in the middle: lost in a spin loving you 
And you don't know: you don't know 
You don't know: you don't know how glad I am 

My love has no bottom: my love has no top 
My love won't rise and my love won't drop 
I'm in the middle and I can't stop loving you 
And you don't know: you don't know 
You don't know: you don't know how glad I am 

I wish I were a poet so I could express 
What I'd: what I'd like to say yeah 
I wish I were an artist so I could paint a picture 
Of how I feel: of how I feel today 

My love has no walls on either side 
That makes my love wider than wide 
I'm in the middle and I can't hide loving you 

(2x) 
And you don't know: you don't know 
You don't know: you don't know how glad I am 

How glad I am (5x)"

Don't throw your love away
For you might need it someday

Don't throw your dreams away: no no no no
Keep them another day
For you might need them someday

Lovers of today
Just throw their dreams away
And play at love
They give their love away
To anyone who'll say: ""I love you.""

Don't throw your love away
For you might need it someday

Lovers of today
Just throw their dreams away
And play at love
They give their love away
To anyone who'll say: ""I love you.""

Go out and have your fun: you better
Have your fun with anyone
But don't throw your love away

Don't throw your love away
For you might need it someday

Don't throw your love away: no no no no
Don't throw your love away"

Not tomorrow: right now
I know it's late: whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away
Please: steal away

Now: don't start thinking: tryin' to make up your mind
Your folks are sleeping: let's not waste any time
I know it's late: whoa I can't wait
So come on and steal away
Please: steal away

I know it's wrong asking this of you
There's no other way I can be with you
If only your folks would approve
Seeing like this we wouldn't have to do
No: no

I won't tell anybody else
I'll keep it to myself
I know it's late: whoa I can't wait

95,Beatles,I Saw Her Standing There,"One: two: three: four!

Well: she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?

Well: she looked at me
And I: I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well: my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa: we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now: I'll never dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well: my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh: we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now: I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
Whoa: since I saw her standing there
Yeah: well: since I saw her standing there"
96,Andy Williams,A Fool Never Learns,"A fool never learns
To get away: just run away before his heart begins to break
A fool never learns
He'll wait around: just hang around to see how much his heart can take
A fool never learns
To some girls love is just a game
And some girls treat all fool the same
A fool never learns
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing

I'm gonna stick by you
I'm a'gonna hang around: wait around
In hopes you'll love me again some day
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time
That there are lots of girls who'd love to be just mine
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again
'Cause I just can't remove the pain
A fool never learns
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing

I'm gonna stick by you
I'm a'gonna hang around: wait around
In hopes you'll love me again some day
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time
That there are lots of girls who'd love to be just mine
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again
'Cause I just can't remove the pain
A fool never learns
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing

And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing"
97,Billy J. Kramer and The Dakotas,Bad To Me,"If you ever leave me: I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me: I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad: if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin'
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad: don't be bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'cause you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know: you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cause they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad: you're not bad to me

But I know you won't leave me 'cause you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know: you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cause they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad: you're not bad to me
They'll be glad: you're not bad to me...: to me...: to me..."
98,Bobby Vinton,There! I've Said It Again,"I love you: there's nothing to hide
It's better than burning inside
I love you: no use to pretend
There! I've said it again

I've said it: what more can I say?
Believe me: there's no other way
I love you: I will to the end
There! I've said it again

I try to drum up
A phrase that will sum up
All that I feel for you
But what good are phrases?
The thought that amazes
Is that you love me and it's heavenly

Forgive me for wanting you so
But one thing I want you to know
I've loved you since heaven knows when
There! I've said it again 

Forgive me for wanting you so
But one thing I want you to know
I've loved you since heaven knows when
There! I've said it again"

100,Searchers,Needles And Pins,"I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I loved
And I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away

But still they begin
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Hey: I thought I was smart
I won her heart
Didn't think I'd do
But now I see
She's worse to him than me
Let her go ahead
Take his love instead
And one day she will see

Just how to say please
And get down on her knees
Yeah: that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins
Hurtin' her: hurtin' her

Why can't I stop
And tell myself I'm wrong
I'm wrong: so wrong
Why can't I stand up
And tell myself I'm strong

Because I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face I loved
And I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away

But still they begin
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Oh: needles and pins
Needles and pins
Needles and pins"
