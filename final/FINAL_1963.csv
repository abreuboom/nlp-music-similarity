2,Beach Boys,Surfin' U.S.A.,"If everybody had an ocean
Across the USA
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californ-i-a
You'd see 'em wearing their baggies
Huarache sandals too
A bushy: bushy blond hairdo

You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar (Inside: outside: USA)
Ventura County line (Inside: outside: USA)
Santa Cruz and Trestle (Inside: outside: USA)
Australia's Narrabeen (Inside: outside: USA)
All over Manhattan (Inside: outside: USA)
And down Doheny Way (Inside: outside: USA)
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' USA

We'll all be planning out a route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxin' down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on safari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'

3,Skeeter Davis,The End Of The World,"Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me anymore

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand: no: I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye"
4,Cascades,Rhythm Of The Rain,"Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her: she took my heart

Rain: please tell me now: does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care?
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her: she took my heart

Rain: won't you tell her that I love her so?
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

Oh: listen to the falling rain
Pitter pater: pitter patter
Oh: oh: oh: listen to: liste to the falling rain
Pitter patter: pitter patter
Oh: oh: oh: listen to: liste to the falling rain"
5,Chiffons,He's So Fine,
6,Bobby Vinton,Blue Velvet,"Blue velvet: oh: oh: oh

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May: her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours: a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

She wore blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be 
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

Blue velvet: ooh"

10,Impressions,It's All Right,"Say it's all right (it's all right)
Say it's all right (it's all right)
It's all right: have a good time
'Cause it's all right: whoa: it's all right

We're gonna move it slow
When lights are low
When you move it slow: it sounds like more
And it's all right: whoa: it's all right

Now listen to the beat
Kinda pat your feet
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right: whoa: it's all right

When you wake up early in the morning
Feelin' sad like so many of us do
Hum a little soul: make life your goal
And surely somethings got to come to you

And say it's all right
Say it's all right
It's all right: have a good time
'Cause it's all right: whoa: it's all right

Now everybody clap your hands
Give yourself a chance
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right: whoa: it's all right

Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
Then my woes got to go
And my love: she will know
From morning: noon and night

And she's got to ...
Say it's all right
Say it's all right
It's all right: have a good time
'Cause it's all right: whoa: it's all right

Now everybody clap your hands
Now give yourselves a chance
You got soul"
11,Andy Williams,Can't Get Used To Losing You,"Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round
Guess I'll get dressed and do the town
I'll find some crowded avenue
Though it will be empty without you

Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say ""Hello""
Couldn't think of anything to say
Since you're gone it happens every day

Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you 

I'll find somebody: wait and see
Who am I kiddin': only me
'Cause no one else could take your place
Guess that I am just a hopeless case

Can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

I can't get used to losin' you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you"

14,Lesley Gore,She's A Fool,"She dunno that she's a lucky girl:
Got the best thing in the whole wide world.
Got a love that's hard to find:
But the boy I wish was mine.

But: she's a fool:
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.

He dunno it but she cheats on him.
With a boy like that: it's such a sin.
I would never be untrue:
I would never make him blue.

But: she's a fool:
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.

I know there's gonna come a day:
He will tell the girl: 'Be on your way:'
Maybe then he'll turn to me:
Then how happy I will be that:

She's a fool:
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.
She's a fool:
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.
She's a fool:
She's a fool"

17,"Peter, Paul and Mary",Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer: my friend: is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind!

How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer: my friend: is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind!

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?

The answer: my friend: is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind!"

19,Nino Tempo and April Stevens,Deep Purple,"When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of my memory: you wander on back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you've gone: your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat: sweet lover: we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of my memory: you wander on back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night once again I hold you tight
Though you've gone: your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat: sweet lover: we'll always meet

I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you

You're the stars in my heaven

You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you

A long long time ago
When I was down
Wo-o-o you picked me up
And showed me true love
Still could be found

You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you

Come and tell me again
You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through

Oh how you tried
To cut me down to size
By telling dirty lies to my friends

Said give her up: don't bother

Talk like a man
Walk like a man my son
No woman's worth
Crawling on the earth
So walk like a man my son

I don't mean maybe
We're gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be crying
On 'count of all you're lying
Oh yeah: just look who's laughing now

I'm gonna walk like a man
Fast as I can
Walk like a man from you
I'll tell the world
Forget about it girl
And walk like a man from you

No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know
I love you so (love you so)

No tears for us
Think love and wear a smile

I got mad at you last night
When you were holding
Another girl tight

I've lost count of the hours 
And I've lost track of the days  
In fact: I've lost just about everything 
Since you went away  
Everything: that is: except the memories you left me
And that's one thing that no one can mar  

I don't know who you're with 
I don't even know where you've gone  
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song 
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you  
And I love you: wherever you are

(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire 
For every day it burns hotter 
And every day it burns higher  
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker 
Not even with all of these tears  

My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am  
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can 
For some day: you might just decide to come home 
And I want you to know   
I'm still here

Through a veil of tears your
Vision disappears and
I'm as blue as I can be!

The county's gonna haul my belongings away 'cause I'm busted.

I went to my brother to ask for a loan 'cause I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone: but I'm busted
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do:
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu:
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted.

Well: I am no thief: but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow:
Me and my family got to pack up and go:
But I'll make a living: just where I don't know 'cause I'm busted.

Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

Into the magic night: I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you

In dreams I walk with you
In dreams I talk to you
In dreams you're mine all the time
We're together in dreams: in dreams

But just before the dawn
I awake and find you gone
I can't help it: I can't help it if I cry

Too bad it only seems
It only happens in my dreams
Only in dreams

So how are they to know
When we met: I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love

Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you

Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day like the tide you began to change
And you became a perfect stranger

That I am losing you

That I am losing you"

Wait and see.

I mean I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits -
Let's see if that puzzle really fits: so fine -
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet:
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat -
When somebody breaks your heart just like you
Broke mine.

When somebody breaks your heart just like you
Broke mine -
Oh yeah.

74,Ned Miller,From A Jack To A King,"From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
And walked away with your heart

From a Jack to a King
With no regret I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
To make me King of your heart
For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart

For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart"
75,Drifters,Up On The Roof,"(Up on the roof)
(Up on the roof)

When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face (Up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space (Up on the roof)

On the roof: it's peaceful as can be
And there: the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)

At night: the stars put on a show for free
And: darling: you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)

Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Oh: come on: baby (Up on the roof)
Oh: come on: honey (Up on the roof)
Everything is all right (Up on the roof)"

And a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

You say that you're at home when you phone me
And how much you really care
Though you keep telling me that you're lonely
I'll know if someone is there

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

One of these days you're gonna be sorry
'Cause your game I'm gonna play
And you'll find out without really tryin'
Each time that my kisses stray

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes
And a thousand eyes will see me too
And no matter what I do
I could never disguise all my little white lies
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes

So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes"

That you were my only one.

I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong: yeah yeah yeah.
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Until I make you: make you my own.

Here I am at Camp Granada
Camp is very entertaining
And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining

I went hiking with Joe Spivy
He developed poison ivy
You remember Leonard Skinner
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner

All the counselors hate the waiters
And the lake has alligators
And the head coach wants no sissies
So he reads to us from something called Ulysses

Now I don't want this should scare ya
But my bunkmate has malaria
You remember Jeffrey Hardy
They're about to organize a searching party

Take me home: oh Muddah: Fadduh
Take me home: I hate Granada
Don't leave me out in the forest where
I might get eaten by a bear
Take me home: I promise I will not make noise
Or mess the house with other boys
Oh please don't make me stay
I've been here one whole day

Dearest Fadduh: darling Muddah
How's my precious little Bruddah?
Let me come home if ya miss me
I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me

Wait a minute: it stopped hailing
Guys are swimming: guys are sailing
Playing baseball: gee: that's better

But now it's Judy's turn to cry

Oh one night I saw them kissing at a party
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and he hit him
'Cause he still loved me that's why

(If I had to choose just one day)

If I had to choose just one day
To last my whole life through
It would surely be that Sunday
The day that I met you

Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
Summer was a-coming in but fast
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
Nodding all together: I could almost hear them whisper
""Go on: kiss her: go on and kiss her""

If I had to choose one moment
To live within my heart
It would be that tender moment
Recalling how we started
Darling: it would be when you smiled at me
That way: that Sunday: that summer
