2,Ray Charles,I Can't Stop Loving You,"(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
Of the lonesome times

(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterdays (dreams of yesterdays)

Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time

(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterdays

(Those happy hours) Those happy hours
(That we once knew) That we once knew
(Though long ago) Though long ago
(Still make me blue) Still make me blue

(They say that time) They say that time
(Heals a broken heart) Heals a broken heart
(But time has stood still) Time has stood still
(Since we've been apart) Since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I said I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time
Sing the song: children

(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
Of dreams of yesterdays (of yesterdays)"

4,Bobby Vinton,Roses Are Red (My Love),"(Roses are red: my love)
(Doo doo da doo)

A long: long time ago 
On graduation day 
You handed me your book 
I signed this way: 

""Roses are red: my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet: my love.
But not as sweet as you.""

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name:

""Roses are red: my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet: my love.
But not as sweet as you."" (as sweet as you)

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter: dear
And I wrote back to you:

""Roses are red: my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet: my love.
But luck may God bless you."" (may God bless you)

Is that your little girl? 
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book: too:

""Roses are red: my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet: my love.
But not as sweet as you.""
(Roses are red)"

You're an angel to me

Johnny Angel
How I love him
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist

Johnny Angel
How I want him
How I tingle when he passes by
Everytime he says hello my heart begins to fly

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me 
And how it's gonna be

Other fellas
Call me out for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

On Johnny Angel
'Cause I love him
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see how lovely heaven will be

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me 
And how it's gonna be

14,Freddy Cannon,Palisades Park,"Last night I took a walk after dark
A swingin' place called palisades park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
After we stopped she was holdin' hands with me
My heart was flyin'

Up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop-the-loop
And around like a merry-go-round

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a ferris wheel
When I fell in love down at palisades park"
15,Neil Sedaka,Breaking Up Is Hard To Do,"Do do do
Down dooby doo down down
Comma: comma: down dooby doo down down
Comma: comma: down dooby doo down down
Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
Cause breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know
I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on: baby: let's start anew
Cause breaking up is hard to do

(They say that breaking up is hard to do)
Now I know
I know that it's true

16,Claude King,Wolverton Mountain,"They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain if you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey and Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers if a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he might take my life
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain it's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter from the one who loves her so
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...
And I don't care about Clifron Clovers I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love I don't care about Clifron Clovers
I'm gonna climb up on that mountain and I'll get the one I love"

18,Johnny Tillotson,It Keeps Right On a-Hurtin',"I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone

It keeps right on a-hurtin' every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it: I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

They say a man should never cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free
But you forgot your memory
And keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

It keeps right on a-hurtin' every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it: I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone"

Darling: please be fair

Why do you flirt and constantly hurt me?
Why do you treat our love so carelessly?

You know I'm jealous of you
And yet you seem to try
To go out of your way
To be unkind

Sweetheart: I'm begging of you
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine

Darling: please don't hurt me
Please: don't make me cry
I don't know what I'd do if you'd ever say goodbye
Remember: I love you so much
And love is life's greatest joy
Please don't break my heart like a child breaks a little toy

Sweetheart: I'm begging of you
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine"

I said there'd be no sorrow
That I'd laugh when you walked away

But a little bitty tear let me down
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown
But a little bitty tear let me down

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another one waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go

But a little bitty tear let me down
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown
But a little bitty tear let me down

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
'Til you walked with your grip through the door

Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown
Oh: but a little bitty tear let me down

If I wait for cloudy skies 
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes 
You'll never know that I still love you so 
Though the heartaches remain 
I'll do my cryin' in the rain 

Rain drops fallin' from heaven 
Could never wash away my misery 
But since we're not together 
I look for stormy weather 
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see 

Some day when my cryin's done 
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun 
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll

61,Ray Stevens,Ahab The Arab,"Let me tell you 'bout Ahab The Arab
The Sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just dripping off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hands

He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And every evening about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde... and ride

Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils: swingingest grade ""A"" number one U.S. choice dancer in the Sultan's whole harem: 'cause: heh: him and her had a thing going. You know: and they'd been carrying on for some time now behind the Sultan's back and you could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the dunes: his voice would cut through the still night desert air and he'd say (imitate Arabian speech) which is Arabic for: ""stop: Clyde!"" and Clyde would say: (imitate camel voice). Which is camel for: ""What the heck did he say anyway?""
Well...

He brought that camel to a screeching halt
At the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde:
Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went
There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug
Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
And a bone in her nose ho: ho.

There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin: grape: apricot: pomegranate: bowl of chitterlings: two bananas: three Hershey bars: sipping on a ""R C"" Co-Cola listening to her transistor: watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung: ""Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?"" and Ahab walked up to her and he said: (imitate Arabian speech) which is Arabic for: ""Let's twist again like we did last summer: baby."" You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug: give him one of the sly looks: she said: ""Crazy baby"".

63,Gene Pitney,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"When Liberty Valance rode to town: the womenfolk would hide: they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around: the men would step aside
'Cause the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast: he was mighty good

From out of the east a stranger came: a law book in his hand: a man
The kind of a man the West would need to tame a troubled land
'Cause the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast: he was mighty good

Many a man would face his gun: and many a man would fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The love of a girl can make a man stay on when he should go: stay on
Just tryin' to build a peaceful life where love is free to grow
But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
When the final showdown came at last: a law book was no good

Alone and afraid: she prayed that he'd return that fateful night: aw: that night
When nothin' she said could keep her man from goin' out to fight
From the moment a girl gets to be full-grown: the very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other: only one returns

Everyone heard two shots ring out: one shot made Liberty fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all"

But remember when a dream appears
You belong to me.

I'll be so alone without you

Watch the jungle when its wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again

And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
'Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

She took my love: said she's not comin' back
So my world and my sky was all turnin' black
Now I see the light: I'm wise to her
'Cause I found that place for lovers who wander

A walkin' around thinkin' about her
Never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart: I really showed it
Look at me now: you'd never know it

Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
My dreams have gone for her
'Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

Wo wo wo yeah: she took my love you see
Yeah: she doesn't bother me

81,Walter Brennan,Old Rivers,"(Words and music by Crofford)

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well: that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground.

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well: we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them.

He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine.

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say: Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow: lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go.

He'd say: one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there among the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow.

--- Instrumental ---

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said: Son
You know old Rivers died.

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule: old Rivers and me.

Now: one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there among the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow.

With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule: old Rivers and me..."

13 men and Kennedy
Aboard the PT 109
To fight the Brazen enemy
On the isle of ol lusana
In the strait beyond nehru
A Jap deatroyer in the night
Cut the '109 in two.

Smokin' fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah: the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

On the coast: commanderos: lookin' through this periscope
Australian niven saw the battle
For the crew had little hope
Two were dead: some were wounded: all were clinging to the bow
Fightin fire: fightin water: trying to save their lives somehow.

Smokin' fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen Gods of old Japan
Yeah: the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

Mac Me hun: the irishman: was burned so badly he couldn't swim
Leave me here: go on he said: 'cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT's skipper wouldn't leave him: a man to die alone at sea
With his strap: between his teeth: he towed the irishman to the sea.

Smokin' fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
They thought they had the best of a mighty good man

He led his men through water's Dark
Rocky reefs and hungry skarks
Braved the enemy's bayonets
A .38 around his neck
4 more days: 4 more nights:
A recue boat pulled into sight
The PT 109 was gone:
But Kennedy and his crew lived on

So who could Guess: and who could possibly know
That this same man named Kennedy: would:
Be the leader of a nation:
Be the one to take command:
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again:

Smokin' fire upon the sea:
Everywhere they looked was the enemy:
But JFK and his crew lived on:
Which proves it's hard to get get the best of a man named John

And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how bad we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do

The young have problems many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us: try to help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart

Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do

How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do"
