1,Elvis Presley,Heartbreak Hotel,"Well: since my baby left me
In the fiery place to dwell
It's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

I've been so lonely: baby
Well: I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely I could die

Oh: although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom

They've been so lonely: baby
Well: they're so lonely
Well: they're so lonely they could die

Now: the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well: they been so long on Lonely Street
They never ever look back

And it's so lonely: baby
Well they're so lonely
Well: they're so lonely they could die

Well: if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

You'll be so lonely: baby
You're gonna be lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die

Oh: although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom

They'll be so lonely: baby
Well: they're so lonely
Well: they'll be so lonely they could die"
2,Elvis Presley,Don't Be Cruel,"You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
A-don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Baby: if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please: let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
A-don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
A-baby: it's still you I'm thinking of: mm

Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
A-don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you: baby: cross my heart

Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say ""I do""
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
A-don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
A-baby: it's still you I'm thinking of

A-don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
A-baby: it's still you I'm thinking of"
3,Nelson Riddle,Lisbon Antigua,
4,Platters,My Prayer,"When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

My prayer
Is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh: tell me the words
That I'm longing to know

My prayer
And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live

That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer"
5,Gogi Grant,The Wayward Wind,"The wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward-bound
Made him a slave to his wandering ways

And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

Oh I met him there in a border town
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best to settle down
I'm now alone with a broken heart

And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
The next of kin to the wayward wind"

Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well: you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

When they said you was high classed
Well: that was just a lie
Yeah: they said you was high classed
Well: that was just a lie

And you ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

9,Dean Martin,Memories Are Made Of This,"(The sweet: sweet memories you've given me
You can't beat the memories you've given me)

Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss
One girl: one boy: some grief: some joy
Memories are made of this

Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold it lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine: two sips of wine
Memories are made of this

Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor

Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you will savor

With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man: one wife: one love through life
Memories are made of this
Memories are made of this"
10,Kay Starr,Rock And Roll Waltz,"One night I was late: came home from a date
Slipped out of my shoes at the door
Then from the front room: I heard a jump tune
I looked in and here's what I saw

There in the night what a wonderful scene
Mom was dancing with Dad to my record machine
And while they danced: only one thing was wrong
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song

One: two and then rock
One: two and then roll
They did the rock and roll waltz
Rock: two: three: roll: two: three
It looked so cute to me
I love the rock and roll waltz

One: two and then rock
One: two and then roll
One: two and then jump
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz

There in the night what a wonderful scene
Mom was dancing with Dad to my record machine
And while they danced: only one thing was wrong
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song

One: two and then rock
One: two and then roll
One: two and then jump
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz
Let's do the rock and roll waltz"
11,Morris Stoloff,"Moonglow And Theme From ""Picnic""",
12,Platters,The Great Pretender,"Oh yes: I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh yes: I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I play the game: but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes: I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not: you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes: I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like the clown
I seem to be what I'm not: you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
(Still around)"
13,Pat Boone,I Almost Lost My Mind,"When I lost my baby (baby)
I almost lost my mind (ooh)
When I lost my baby (baby)
I almost lost my mind (ooh)
My head is in a spin since she's left me behind

I went to see the gypsy
And had my fortune read
I went to see the gypsy
And had my fortune read
I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said

Well: I can tell you people (people)
The news was not so good (ooh)
Well: I can tell you people (people)
The news was not so good
She said: ""Your baby's left you.
This time she's gone for good"" (gone for good)"
14,Elvis Presley,"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You","Hold me close: hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start
I want you: I need you: I love you
With all my heart

Ev'ry time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling: you're all that I'm living for
I want you: I need you: I love you
More and more

I thought I could live without romance
Before you came to me
But now I know that
I will go on loving you eternally

Won't you please be my own?
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die ev'ry time we're apart
I want you: I need you: I love you
With all my heart"

16,Perry Como,Hot Diggity,"Oh: hot diggity: dog ziggity: boom what you do to me
It's so new to me: what you do to me
Hot diggity: dog ziggity: boom what you do to me
When you're holding me tight

Never dreamed anybody could kiss that away
Bring me bliss that away: what a kiss that away
What a wonderful feelin' to feel that away
Tell me where have you been all my life

Never knew that my heart could go ""zing"" that away
Ting-a-ling that away: make me sing that away
Said ""goodbye"" to my troubles: they went that away
Ever since you came into my life

There's a cute little cottage for two that away
Skies are blue that away: dreams come true that away
If you say I can share it with you that away
I'll be happy the rest of my life

Oh: hot diggity: dog ziggity: boom what you do to me
How my future will shine
Hot diggity: dog ziggity: boom what you do to me
From the moment you're mine

18,Carl Perkins,Blue Suede Shoes,"Well: it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go: cat: go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well: you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do: but uh-uh
Honey: lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruitjar
Do anything that you want to do: but uh-uh
Honey: lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well: it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go: cat: go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes"
19,Jim Lowe,The Green Door,"(Midnight one more night without sleepin'
Watchin' till the mornin' comes creepin'
Green door what's that secret you're keepin'?)

There's an old piano
And they play it hot
Behind the green door
Don't know what they're doin'
But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out
What's behind the green door

(Knocked once
Tried to tell 'em I've been there
Door slammed
Hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's goin' on in there)

Saw an eyeball peepin'
Through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me
Someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door
All I want to do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door

(Midnight one more night without sleepin'
Watchin' till the mornin' comes creepin'
Green door what's that secret you're keepin'?
Green door what's that secret you're keepin'?
Green door)"
20,Four Lads,"No, Not Much",
21,Bill Doggett,Honky Tonk, Instrumental
22,Tennessee Ernie Ford,Sixteen Tons,"Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number-nine coal
And the straw boss said: ""Well bless my soul!""

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning: it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebreak by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't: a lotta men died
One fist of iron: the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons: whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me: 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store"

You belong - to somebody new
But Tonight you belong to me...
Although (Although)
We're apart - your part of my heart...
And tonight you belong to me...
Way down by the stream...
How sweet it will seem...

But tonight you belong to me...
Way down way down along the stream...

28,Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers,Why Do Fools Fall In Love,"Ooh wah: ooh wah: ooh wah: ooh wah:
Ooh wah: ooh wah: Why do fools fall in love

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Love is a losing game:
Love can be a shame I
Know of a fool: you see:
For that fool is me!
Tell me why: tell me why?

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
For I know it will reach defeat!
Tell me why: tell me why?
Why do fools fall in love?"
29,Four Lads,Standing On The Corner,"Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
Brother you don't know a nicer occupation
Matter of fact: neither do I
Than standing on the corner watching all the girls
Watching all the girls: watching all the girls go by

I'm the cat that got the cream
Haven't got a girl but I can dream
Haven't got a girl but I can wish
So I'll take me down to Mainstreet
And that's where I select my imaginary dish

Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by
Standing on the corner giving all the girls the eye
Brother if you've got a rich imagination
Give it a whirl: give it a try
Try standing on the corner watching all the girls
Watching all the girls: watching all the girls go by

Saturday and I'm so broke
Haven't got a girl and no joke
Still I'm living like a millionaire
When I take me down to Mainstreet
When I take me down to Mainstreet
And I review the harem
Parading for me there

Standing on the corner
Watching all the girls go by
Standing on the corner
Underneath the springtime sky
Brother: you can't go to jail
For what you're thinking
Or for the woo look in your eye
You're only standing on the corner
Watching all the girls
Watching all the girls
Watching all the girls
Go by"

35,Vic Damone,On The Street Where You Live,"Oh: the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near

I have often walked on this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No: it's just on the street where you live

Oh: the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare: they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by: I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live"

All the more I love you ...

I need you more each day:
Much more than words can say...
More than forevermore:
I'll be yours...

The silver moon will fade too soon:
And bring the dawn when you'll be gone ...
Before you go: please let me know:
That what you feel is really real ...

So do not grieve that I must leave:
Because I live only for:
Your love an' mine:
More and more!

More than forevermore:

40,Guy Mitchell,Singing The Blues,"Well: I never felt more like singin' the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose

41,Fats Domino,Blueberry Hill,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill: when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

Though we're apart: you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Though we're apart: you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill"

Tooling down the highway doing 79
I'm a twin pipe papa and I'm feelin' fine
Hey man dig that was that a red stop sign-
Transfusion transfusion
I'm just a solid mess of contusions
Never never never gonna speed again
Slip the blood to me Bud

I jump in my rod about a quarter to nine
I gotta make a date with that chick of mine
I cross the center line man you gotta make time-
Transfusion transfusion
Oh man I got the cotton pickin' convolutions
Never never never gonna speed again
Shoot the juice to me Bruce

My foot's on the throttle and it's made of lead
But I'm a fast ridding daddy with a real cool head
I'ma gonna pass a truck on the hill ahead-
Transfusion transfusion
My red corpsuckles are in mass confusion
Never never never gonna speed again
Pass the crimson to me Jimson

I took a little drink and I'm feelin' right
I can fly right over everything everything in sight
There's a slow poking cat I'm gonna pass him on the right-
Transfusion transfusion
I'm a real gone paleface and that's no illusion
I'ma never never never gonna speed again
Pass the claret to me Barrett

A rollin' down the mountain on a rainy day
Oh when you see me coming better start to pray
I'ma cuttin' up the road and I'm the boss all the way-
Transfusion transfusion
Oh doc pardon me for this crazy intrusion
I'm never never never gonna speed again
Pump the fluid in me Louie

I'm burning up the highway early this morn
I'm passing everybody oh nothing but corn
Man outa my way I don't drive with my horn-
Transfusion transfusion
Oh nurse I'm gonna make a new resolution
I'm never never never gonna speed again
Put a gallon in me Alan

Oh barnyard drivers are found in two classes
Line crowding hogs and speeding jackasses
So remember to slow down today
Hey daddy-o
Make that type O huh

A tear fell when I saw you in the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me all alone and feeling blue
A tear fell when you told me that your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops but I miss you constantly

A fool am I: a fool am I: in love

The teardrop that you stepped on as you danced across the floor
Were crushed like my poor heart was when you walked out of my door
A tear fell when you told me that the flame in your heart died
Darling have I lost you like these tear drops from my eyes

A fool am I: a fool am I: in love

A tear fell when you told me that your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops but I miss you constantly

A fool am I: a fool am I: in love"

Now this here's the story about the Rock Island Line
The Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleasn
And just outside of New Orleans is a big toll gate
And all the trains that go through the toll gate
They gotta pay the man some money
But of course: if you got certain things on board
You're okay and you don't have to pay the man nothin'
And just now we see a change comin' down the line
When you come up to the toll gate
The driver: he shout down to the man
I got pigs: I got horses: I got cows
I got sheep: I got all livestock: I got all livestock
I got all livestock
The man say: you all right boy just
Get on through: you don't have to pay me nothin'
And then the train go through
And when he go through the tollgate
The train gotta have a little bit of steam
And a little bit of speed
And when the driver think he safely on the other side
He shouts back down the line to the man
I fooled you: I fooled you
I got pig iron: I got pig iron
I got all pig iron
Now I'll tell you where I'm goin' boy

I know that you're jealous
But there's no one but you

Could have cheated lots of times - but just couldn't do

Was the most I bargained for

We strolled the fields and farms
At the last light of evening

And lonely for me
I just recall
Picnic time with you

Calling out to her baby as the train pulled away

Throw mama from the train a kiss: a kiss
Dry mama all your tears: won't you try?
Throw mama from the train a kiss: a kiss
And eat mama up all her pie

Can't believe that she's gone now: it's a lonely old town
Yet I know that her heavenly love keeps looking down
'Cause whenever I happen to be passing through
I could swear she was there with the warmth I once knew

Deep in your heart
There is nothing that you can do
To make her stay (To make her stay):
To turn the tide (To turn the tide): 
To ease the pain (To ease the pain)
That you feel down inside?


When her eyes 
Say it's over and done:
Then you simply must face the fact.
So you leave and think it over:
But you come hurrying back
Hoping she'll change her mind:
Praying she'll take you back.
But like the lady said:
""That's all there is to that.""

But my real name is Mr. Earl
Umm-hm-hm

Well now: some may call me: Moe
Some may call me: Joe
Just remember Speedo
He don't never take it slow

Well now: they often call me Speedo
But my real name is Mr. Earl

Well now: they often call me Speedo
But my real name is Mr. Earl

And now they got to call me Speedo

91,Peggy Lee,Mr Wonderful,"Why this feeling? Why this glow?
Why the thrill when you say hello?
It's a strange and tender magic you do
Mister Wonderful: that's you.

Why this trembling when you speak
Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful: that's you.

And why this longing to know your charms
To spend forever here in your arms

Oh there's much more I could say
But the words keep slipping away
And I'm left with one point of view
Mister Wonderful: that's you

One more thing: then I'm through
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful
Mister Wonderful: I love you"
92,Fats Domino,My Blue Heaven,"Day is ending
Birds are wending
Back to the shelter of
Each little nest they love

Nightshades falling
Lovebirds calling
What makes the world go round?
Nothing but love

When Whip-poor-wills call
And ev'ning is nigh
I hurry to
My blue heaven

I turn to the right
A little white light
Will lead you to
My blue heaven

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace
A cozy room
A little nest
That's nestled where
The roses bloom

Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in
My blue heaven

Doo doo doo doo doo
Da da da da da

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace
A cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom

Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three
We're happy in
My blue heaven

We're happy in my blue heaven"
93,Clyde McPhatter,Treasure of Love,"A treasure of love: is easy to find
It's waiting for you: if your hear: ar: art isn't blind
A treasure of love: is not very far
It glows like fire and it shi-i-ines: like a star

It's stronger than diamonds and worth more than gold
This is a treasure that never grows old
The treasure of love is found on no chart
To find where it is just look in your heart

It's stronger than diamonds and worth more than gold
This is a treasure that never grows old
The treasure of love is found on no chart
To find where it is just lo-a-ook in your heart"

Well: come on: baby: let's go downtown

96,Lawrence Welk,Tonight You Belong to Me,
97,Chordettes,Lay Down Your Arms,"My sweetheart is a soldier
As handsome as can be
But suddenly they sent him
Away across the sea

So patiently I waited
Until his leave was due
Then wrote and said ""My darling:
I'll tell you what to do""

Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen where the roses en-twine
Lay down your arms (Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms and surrender to mine

A soldier is a soldier
And when he's on parade
An order is an order
And has to be obeyed

You've got to do your duty
Wherever you may be
And now you're under orders
To hurry home to me

Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen where the roses en-twine
Lay down your arms (Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms and surrender to mine

The girl who loves a soldier
Is either sad or gray
'Cause first of all he's with her
And then he's far away
But soldiers have their duty
To answer to the call
And that is why I'm calling
The loudest of them all

Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen where the roses en-twine
Lay down your arms (Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms and surrender to mine"

99,Teresa Brewer,Bo Weevil,"On Saturday night
Where I was born
Down on the farm
Guitar plinkin'
And we started singin'
Till the break of dawn

About twelve o'clock
Everything gets hot
Up steps Bob Jones
We started clappin'
And he started singin'
Sweet little country songs

Bo Weevil: Bo Weevil
Where ya been all day?
Your Mama's been lookin'
Hasn't stopped lookin'
Since you went away

Bo Weevil: Bo Weevil
Why did you go and stay?
You'll get a lickin'
As sure as I'm sittin'
On this bale of hay

Bo Weevil: Weevil
Do do: do do: do do
Bo Weevil: Weevil
Do do: do do: do
