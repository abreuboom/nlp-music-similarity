1,Barbra Streisand,The Way We Were,"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me: would we?
Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"
2,Terry Jacks,Seasons In The Sun,"Goodbye to you: my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABCs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye my friend: it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

Goodbye papa: please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye papa: it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them: I'll be there

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons: have all gone

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons: have all gone

Goodbye Michelle: my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye Michelle: it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song 
Like the seasons: have all gone

All our lives we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed 
Were just seasons out of time

We had joy: we had fun
We had seasons in the sun"

8,Ray Stevens,The Streak,"Hello: everyone: this is your Action News reporter with all the news
that is news across the nation: on the scene at the supermarket.  There
seems to have been some disturbance here.  Pardon me: sir: did you see
what happened?

Yeah: I did.  I's standin' overe there by the tomaters: and here he
come: running through the pole beans: through the fruits and vegetables:
nekkid as a jay bird!  And I hollered over t' Ethel: I said: ""Don't
look: Ethel!""  But it's too late: she'd already been incensed!

Here he comes: 
(boogity boogity)
There he goes: 
(boogity boogity)
And he ain't wearin' no clothes

Oh yes: they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
Fastest thing on two feet
(boogity boogity)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He gon' give us a peek

Oh: yes: they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
He likes to show off his physique
(boogity boogity)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique

This is your Action News reporter once again and we're here at the gas
station.  Pardon me: sir: did you see what happened?

Yeah: I did.  I's just in here gettin my tires checked: he just appeared
out of the traffic.  Come streakin' around the grease rack there: didn't
have nothin' on but a smile.  I looked in there: and Ethel was gettin'
her a cold drink.  I hollered: ""Don't look: Ethel!""  But it was too
late.  She'd already been mooned.  Flashed her right there in front of
the shock absorbers.

He ain't rude: 
(boogity boogity)
He ain't lewd: 
(boogity boogity)
He's just in the mood to run in the nude

Oh: yes: they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
He likes to turn the other cheek
(boogity boogity)
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique

Once again: your Action News reporter in the booth at the gym: covering
the disturbance at the basketball playoff.  Pardon me: sir: did you see
what happened?

Yeah: I did.  Half time: I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow
cone.  And here he come: right out of the cheap seats: dribbling: right
down the middle of the court.  Didn't have on nothing but his Keds.
Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand.  I hollered up
at Ethel: I said: ""Don't look: Ethel!""  But it was too late.  She'd
already got a free shot.  Grandstandin': right there in front of the
home team.

Oh: yes: they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
The fastest thing on two feet
(boogity boogity)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He gon' give us a peek

Here he comes again
Who's that with him?
Ethel? Is that you: Ethel?
What do you think you're doin'?
You git your clothes on!

Oh: yes: they call him the Streak
(boogity boogity)
He likes to show off his physique
(boogity boogity)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique

Ethel! Where you goin'?
Ethel: you shameless hussy!
Say it isn't so: Ethel!

9,Elton John,Bennie And The Jets,"Hey kids: shake it loose together 
The spotlight's hitting something 
That's been known to change the weather

So stick around

Solid walls of sound

Buh: buh: buh: Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids: plug into the faithless 
Maybe they're blinded 
But Bennie makes them ageless 
We shall survive
Let us take ourselves along 
Where we fight our parents out in the streets 
To find who's right and who's wrong

Oh: Candy and Ronnie: have you seen them yet

10,Mac Davis,One Hell Of A Woman,"Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way.
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better loking each day.
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
I used to have a girlfriend
But she just couldn't compete
With all of these love starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet.
Well I prob'ly could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me.
Who cares: I never get lonesome
'Cause I treasure my own company.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way:
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
I guess you could say I'm a loner:
A cowboy outlaw tough and proud.
I could have lots of friends if I want to
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd.
Some folks say that I'm egotistical.
Hell: I don't even know what that means.
I guess it has something to do with the way that I
Fill out my skin tight blue jeans.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way:
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man.
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can.
We're doing the best that we can"

13,Maria Muldaur,Midnight At The Oasis,"Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven's holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let's slip off to
A sand dune: real soon
And kick up a little dust

Come on: cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on: till the evening ends
Till the evening ends

You don't have to answer
There's no need to speak
I'll be your belly dancer: prancer
And you can be my sheik

I know your Daddy's a sultan
A nomad known to all
With fifty girls to attend him
They all send him
Jump at his beck and call

But you won't need no harem: honey
When I'm by your side
And you won't need no camel: no no
When I take you for a ride

Come on: cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on: till the evening ends
Till the evening ends

Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Got shadows painting our faces
And traces of romance in our heads

Oh come on: oh come on
Woo hoo hoo: yeah: oh yeah"

15,Al Wilson,Show And Tell,"These are the eyes that never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life (do-do-do-do-do)
And these are the arms that long to lock you inside
Every day and every night (do-do-do-do-do)

Girl: and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right?

Whoa: show and tell: just a game I play
When I want to say I love you
Girl: so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do: baby

These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere in sight (anywhere in sight)
And these are the lips that can't help calling your name
In the middle of the night (middle of the night)

16,Jim Stafford,Spiders And Snakes,"I remember when Mary Lou 
Said: ""you want to walk me home from school?""
Well: I said: ""yes: I do""
She said: ""I don't have to go right home
And I'm the kind that likes to be alone some if you would""
I said: ""me: too""

And so we took a stroll
Wound up down by the swimming hole
And she said: ""do what you want to do""
I got silly and I found a frog
In the water by a hollow log
And I shook it at her and I said: ""this frog's for you""
She said

I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool: you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you

Well: I think of that girl from time to time
I call her up when I got a dime
I say: ""hello: baby""
She says: ""ain't you cool""
I say: ""do you remember when?
And would you like to get together again?""
She says: ""I'll see you after school""

I was shy and so for a while
Most of my love was touch and smile
Till she said: ""come on over here""
I was nervous: as you might guess
Still looking for something to slip down her dress
And she said: ""let's make it perfectly clear""
She said 

I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool: you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you"

18,John Denver,Sunshine On My Shoulders,"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you a day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely

Step right up: hurry: hurry: before the show begins: my friends
Stand in line: get your tickets: I hope you will attend

What life has done to those like you and me

See the man with the broken heart: you'll see that he is sad

It's more exciting than a one man band
The saddest little show in all the land

So let the sideshow begin (hurry: hurry)
Hurry: hurry: step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

Let the sideshow begin
Hurry: hurry: step right on in

20,Blue Swede,Hooked On A Feeling,"I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Girl: you just don't realize
What you do to me

When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Everything's all right

I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

Lips are sweet as candy
Its taste is on my mind
Girl: you got me thirsty
For another cup of wine

Got a bug from you: girl
But I don't need no cure
I just stay a victim
If I can for sure

All the good love
When we're all alone
Keep it up: girl
Yeah: you turn me on

I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

All the good love
When we're all alone
Keep it up: girl
Yeah: you turn me on

I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

I'm hooked on a feeling
And I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

I said: I'm hooked on a feeling
And I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
Hooked on a feeling"

Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day if I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here
 
Well: the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to be the second one there
I hope you're having fun
 
Band on the run: band on the run
And the jailer man and sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run: band on the run
Band on the run: band on the run
 
Well: the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run
 
Band on the run: band on the run
And the jailer man and sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run: band on the run
 
Yeah the band on the run: the band on the run
Band on the run: band on the run
 
Well: the night was falling as a desert world
Began the settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found
 
Band on the run: band on the run
And the county judge who held a grudge
Will search for evermore
For the band on the run: the band on the run
Band on the run: band on the run"

Hey: if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh: won't you tell her that I love her?

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So: hey: did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin': cryin'?

Hey: if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh: won't you tell her that I love her?

If you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh: won't you tell her that I love her?"
24,Jim Croce,Time In A Bottle,"If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again: I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do: once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do: once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with"
25,John Denver,Annie's Song,"You fill up my senses
Like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain

Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again

Come let me love you
Let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter
Let me die in your arms

Let me lay down beside you
Let me always be with you
Come let me love you
Come love me again

Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you
Come love me again

You fill up my senses
Like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain

Like a storm in the desert
Like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses
Come fill me again"
26,Paul Anka,(You're) Having My Baby,"You're having my baby
What a lovely way of saying how much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying what you're thinking of me

I can see it
Your face is glowing
I can see it in your eyes
I'm happy in knowing

That you're having my baby
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doing to you
You're having my baby
You're a woman in love and I love what's going through you

The need inside you
I see it showing
Oh: the seed inside you: baby
Do you feel it growing?
Are you happy in knowing

That you're having my baby?
I'm a woman in love and I love what it's doing to me
Having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what's going through me

Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put you through it
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No: you wouldn't do it

And you're having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what it's doing to me
Having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what's going through me

Having my baby (having my baby)

27,Olivia Newton-John,Let Me Be There,"Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I always wanna be there
Holding you hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through
In everything you do

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
Oh: let me be there

Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I always wanna be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on: here I am
Whenever you call: you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there"
28,Gordon Lightfoot,Sundown,"I can see her lying back in her satin dress
In a room where you do what you don't confess

Sundown: you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sundown: you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs

She's been looking like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain

I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her loving is your first mistake

Sundown: you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winning when I'm losing again

I can see her looking fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard loving woman: got me feeling mean

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain
Sundown: you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs

Sundown: you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winning when I'm losing again"

32,Olivia Newton-John,If You Love Me (Let Me Know),"You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you

The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says ""hello: it's good to see you"" 
Anytime I turn around to find you there

It's this and so much more that make me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be

If you love me let me know
If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute
Of a day without you in it
If you love me let it be
If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Take the chains away
That keep me loving you
Loving you"
33,Cher,Dark Lady,"The fortune queen of New Orleans
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches from
The marks of men her fortune she had won

Couldn't see through the tinted glass
She said: ""Home James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money: she said: ""I'll be with you soon""

Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done

Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself

She dealt two cards
A queen and a three
And mumbled some words
That were so strange to me

And then she turned up
A two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red
But the card still stayed black

She said: ""The man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face""

Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done

Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself

So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room

So I sneaked back and caught her with my man
Laughing and kissing 'till they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore

Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done

Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself"

39,Carpenters,Top Of The World,"Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around?
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around?
Your love's put me at the top of the world

The noon bells rings: you know that's my cue
I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two!

Checkin' out the halls: makin' sure the coast is clear
Lookin' in the stalls: ""No: there ain't nobody here!""
Oh: my buddy Fang: and me and Paul
To get caught would surely be the death of us all

47,Paper Lace,The Night Chicago Died,"Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago
Back in the USA: back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still
When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother: what a night it really was?
Brother: what a fight it really was?
Glory be!

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother: what a night the people saw?
Brother: what a fight the people saw?
Yes: indeed

And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old East Side
Till the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died
There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
"" 'Bout a hundred cops are dead"".

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother: what a night it really was?
Brother: what a fight it really was?
Glory be!

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother: what a night the people saw?
Brother: what a fight the people saw?
Yes: indeed

Then there was no sound at all
But the clock upon the wall
Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my momma's face
And he brushed her tears away

The night Chicago died
Na-na na: na-na-na: na-na-na-na-na
The night Chicago died
Brother: what a night the people saw
Brother: what a fight the people saw
Yes: indeed

The night Chicago died
Na-na na: na-na-na: na-na-na-na-na
The night Chicago died
Brother: what a night it really was
Brother: what a fight it really was
Glory be!

The night Chicago died
Na-na na: na-na-na: na-na-na-na-na
The night Chicago died
Brother: what a night the people saw"

Oh yeah: and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself

Waterloo - I was defeated: you won the war

Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

My my: I tried to hold you back but you were stronger

I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes: no sleep
No light: no sound
Nothing to eat: no books to read

Making love with you
Has left me peaceful: warm and tired
What more could I ask?
There's nothing left to be desired

Peace came upon me
And it leaves me weak
So sleep: silent angel: go to sleep

Sometimes
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes: to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Peace came upon me
And it leaves me weak
So sleep: silent angel: go to sleep

I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling

I'm in trouble
'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet talking ladies man
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot: hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting
Hurting too
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom"

You won't see me.

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through: my hands are tied
I won't want to stay: I don't have much to say
But I can turn away if you won't see me
You won't see me.

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'.

Though the days are few: they're filled with tears
And since I lost you: it feels like years
Yes: it seems so long since you've been gone
And I just can't go on: if you won't see me

57,Helen Reddy,You And Me Against The World,"Tell me again: mommy

You and me against the world
Sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
When all the others turn their backs and walk away
You can count on me to stay

Remember when the circus came to town
And you were frightened by the clown
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for you 

And me against the world
Sometimes it feels like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried
I always felt that God was on our side

And when one of us is gone
And one of us is left to carry on
Then remembering will have to do
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you
You and me against the world

And when one of us is gone
And one of us is left to carry on
Then remembering will have to do
Our memories alone will get us through
Think about the days of me and you
You and me against the world

I love you: mommy
I love you too: baby"

It's my baby calling: says ""I need you here""

When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio is playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a line in the sky

No more speed: I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now: gotta take care
Last car to pass: here I go
And the line of cars goes down real slow

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh: one more radar lover gone

Glory hallelujah so the

Come on: y'all: now
Put your hands together
Put your hands together

We got to pray for all the people
Who are sleeping in the street
Pray for all the people
Who don't have enough to eat
Let us pray that tomorrow
There'll be a better day to come
Yeah: yeah: yeah

We got to put our forces together
Sing a song so loud: so fair
That the birds in the trees
Hum along with me
Sweet harmony

Then let it thunder
Let it lightning: let it rain
Let it rain: let it rain
'Cause we're gonna sing
Glory hallelujah so the
Whole wide world can hear

70,Cat Stevens,Oh Very Young,"Oh very young: what will you leave us this time
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
Denim blue: fading up to the sky
And though you want them to last forever: you know they never will
You know they never will
And the patches make the goodbye harder still

Oh very young: what will you leave us this time
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven
And though you want to last forever: you know you never will
You know you never will
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still

Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you ride
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Oh very young: what will you leave us this time
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
Oh very young: what will you leave us this time"
71,Helen Reddy,Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress),"Big old Ruby Red Dress
Wanders 'round the town
Talking to herself now
Sometimes sitting down
Don't you get too close now
Ruby runs away
Poor old Ruby Red Dress
Born on a sorry day
I can hear her say

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh: leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Yes: leave me
Leave me

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
God: leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Oh: leave me
Leave me

Big old Ruby Red Dress
Everybody laughs
Say she's got no future
And never made no past
Something hurt that Ruby
Something she can't bare
You look at her real close now
You see a little tear
When she says now

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
God: leave me alone
Oh: leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Please leave me
Leave me

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh: leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Oh leave me
Leave me

Some folks say some farm boy
Oh: from Tennessee
Taught it all to Ruby
Then just let her be
Her daddy tried to hide it
Tried to keep things cool
But something happened to Ruby
She broke down to a fool
Who just said now

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh: leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Yes leave me
Leave me

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
God: leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Please leave me
Leave me

Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone"
72,Chicago,(I've Been) Searchin' So Long,"As my life goes on: I believe
Somehow: something's changed
Something deep inside: ooh: a part of me

There's a strange new light in my eyes
Things I've never known
Changing my life: changing me

I've been searchin' so long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning: oh

Now I see myself as I am
Feeling very free
Life is everything: ooh: it's meant to be

When my days have come to an end
I will understand
What I left behind: part of me

I've been searchin' so long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning: woah: woah

Searching (don't you know I'm: oh yeah) for an answer
To the question: oh yeah: who am I
Baby (baby it's true): it's only natural
Good things in life take a long time"
73,Elton John,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

So: goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plow

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh: I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet they shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels: who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you: on the ground

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

So: goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plow

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh: I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

You wanna do things: do things: do things: good things with it
Talk about cash money: money
Talk about cash money- dollar bills: y'all

For the love of money
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money
People will rob their own brother
For the love of money
People can't even walk the street
Because they never know who in the world they're gonna beat
For that lean: mean: mean green
Almighty dollar: money

For the love of money
People will lie: Lord: they will cheat
For the love of money
People don't care who they hurt or beat
For the love of money
A woman will sell her precious body
For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight
Call it lean: mean: mean green

Almighty dollar

I know money is the root of all evil
Do funny things to some people
Give me a nickel: brother can you spare a dime
Money can drive some people out of their minds

Got to have it: I really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Some people really need it
How many things have I heard you say
Got to have it: I really need it
How many things have I heard you say

Save your soul: don't sell it

Lay down: lay down: a woman will lay down
For the love of money
All for the love of money
Don't let: don't let: don't let money rule you
For the love of money
Money can change people sometimes
Don't let: don't let: don't let money fool you
Money can fool people sometimes
People! Don't let money: don't let money change you:
It will keep on changing: changing up your mind."
76,Eric Clapton,I Shot The Sheriff,"I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy

All around in my hometown
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of the deputy
For the life of a deputy: but I said

I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense
I shot the sheriff
And they say it is a capital offense

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what: I don't know
But every time that I plant a seed
He said ""Kill it before it grows""
He said ""Kill it before it grows""

I said
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self defense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town: yeah
All of a sudden I see Sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot: I shot him down: I said

I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy

Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket falls to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes: one day the bottom will drop out: I said

I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy
Oh no: oh no
I shot the sheriff
But I did not shoot no deputy
Oh no"
77,Paul McCartney and Wings,Jet,"I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told 'em that you were going to be marrying soon
And Jet
I thought the only lonely place was on the moon
 
Was your father as bold as a sergeant major?
Well how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?
And Jet
I thought the major was a lady sufragette
 
Ah: mater: want Jet to always love me?
Ah: mater: much later
 
With the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet
I thought the major was a little lady suffragette
 
And Jet
You know I thought you was a little lady suffragette
 
A little lady: my little lady yes!"
78,Elton John,Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,"I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Although I search myself: it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find: oh: the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me: just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have: oh they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Although I search myself: it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Although I search myself: it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free: yeah
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me"

And I wanna try for you 'cause

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you: lover: when I sing to you

Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you: love is what I bring to you

And I wanna sing to you: oh

I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through

That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me

Think of me

I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should

87,Lamont Dozier,Trying To Hold On To My Woman,"I'm just tryin' to hold on to my woman
To my life
I've got a woman that satisfies my every need
She's got a formula guaranteed to please
You know what: there was once a time
When I ran the streets
And tryin' to sweep all the girls
Off their feet
But that kind of kind
It only destroys
And that's why I have no desire
To paint the town with the boys
I stay home
I just tryin': tryin' ta hold on: hold on
To my...: ah
My woman: my life

I feel like I want to testify
For all the wrong I've done
She never once complained
She stuck beside me
All through the sunshine and rain
And I don't gamble with her love
That's something I couldn't stand to lose
Her confidence in me
I don't dare misuse
If I get the urge to go
She may not know where I'm goin'
But I don't fear me
That when I come in
She knows where I been

In my life she's first and she's last
She's my future
And I'm telling you all
She my past
And for what she's given me
I can never repay
I can only hope (only hope)
Only hope (only hope)
That she let me (let me)
Let me (let me)
I said let me (let me)
Serve her for the rest of her days
Always and always

I'm just tryin' to hold on: hold on
To my...
To my home and my life love
Some call me henpecked
For giving my woman the proper respect
But I don't care
I don't mind if they tease me
As long as my woman is pleasing me
I'm just tryin' ta
Tryin' ta: tryin' ta
Tryin' ta
Hold on
To my...
My woman my life"

And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me
A Very special love song

And Babe: if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it: babe
If there's a melody: I'll play it
And I'll play it through especially for you
And all the words are true
A very special love song

So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it
'Cause I'm gonna sing it to the whole big lonely world
So turn your radio way down low and get near it
And I'll tell the world I love you girl

Babe: if there's an ounce of love: I'm gonna give it to you: babe
If there's a breath of life: I'm gonna live it
Every day for you and all the whole night through
Singing just for you a very special love song
For you"
90,Jim Stafford,My Girl Bill,"Bill walked me to my door last night:
And he said: Before I go
There's something about our love affair:
That I have a right to know
I said: Let's not stand out here like this:
What would the neighbors think?
Why don't we just step inside:
And I'll fix us both a drink.

My girl Bill
My: my: girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel:
About my girl: my girl Bill.

William's hands were shaking:
As he took his glass of wine.
And I could see we both felt the same:
And when his eyes met mine:
I said: Who we love and why we love:
It's hard to understand.
Let's just sit here on the couch:
And face this: man to man.

My girl Bill
My: my: girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel:
About my girl: my girl Bill.

Bill: you know we just left her place:
And we both know what she said.
She doesn't want to see your face:
And she wishes you were dead!
Now: I know we both love her:
And I guess we always will.
But you're gonna have to find another:
'Cause she's my girl: Bill!

My girl Bill
My: my: girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel:
About my girl: talkin' 'bout my little girl:
My girl: Bill."

Glasgow town never brought me down when I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty: and the kendal freeway is fast

And they never gonna take her away

M6 south down Liverpool: where they play the west coast sound
Sailor sam: he came from Birmingham: but he never will be found
Doin' fine when a london sign: greets me like a long lost friend
Mister motor won't you check her out: she's gotta take me back again

Helen (helen) hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen (helen) hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Got no time for a rum and lime: I wanna get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus: I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day upon the motorway: where the carburettors blast

Reached down for a weed to chew on:
Things got fuzzy and things got blurry:
And then everything was gone!
Didn't know what happened:
But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin burlap.

I come to and my brother was there:
And he said: What's wrong with your eyes?
I said: I don't know: I was chewing on a weed.
He said: Let me give it a try.
We spent the rest of that day and most of that night:
Trying to find my brother: Bill.
Caught up with him: bout six oclock the next morning:
Naked: swinging on the wind mill!
He said he flew up there.
I had to fly up there and bring him down:
He was about half crazy ...

The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds:
And put 'em in the sun to dry.
Then we mashed 'em up and chopped 'em up:
And put 'em in the corncob pipe.
Smokin' that wildwood flower got to be a habit:
We didn't see no harm.
We thought it was kind of handy:
Take a trip and never leave the farm!

All good things gotta come to an end:
And it's the same with the wildwood weed.
One day this feller from Washington came by:
And he spied it and turned white as a sheet.
Then they dug and they burned:
And they burned and they dug:
And they killed all our cute little weeds.
Then they drove away:
We just smiled and waved ...
Sittin' there on that sack of seeds!

Y'all come back now: hear?"
94,First Class,Beach Baby,"Do you remember back in old L.A. (oh oh oh)
When everybody drove a Chevrolet (oh oh oh)
Whatever happened to the boy next door
The sun-tanned crew-cut all-American male

Remember dancing at the high school hop (oh oh oh)
The dress I ruined with the soda pop (oh oh oh)
I didn't recognize the girl next-door
The beat up sneakers and the pony tail

Beach baby: beach baby: give me your hand
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before: we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby: beach baby: there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun: we'd be out in the sun every day

Mmm: I never thought that it would end (ooh ooh)
Mmm: and I was everybody's friend (ooh ooh)
Long hot days
Blue sea haze
Jukebox plays
But now it's fading away

We couldn't wait for graduation day (oh oh: no)
We took the car and drove to San Jose (oh oh oh)
That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything

Beach baby: beach baby: give me your hand (give me your hand)
Give me somethin' that I can remember (give me something to remember)
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby: beach baby: there on the sand (there on the sand)
From July to the end of September (from July to September)
Surfin' was fun: we'd be out in the sun every day

Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Do do: do do do do
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Do do: do do do do
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Do do: do do do do
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Do do: do do do do
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Beach baby: beach baby
Do do: do do do do"

Used to run together
Me and baby brother
Used to run together

Welcome one another

Chippin' on his mind

97,Olivia Newton-John,I Honestly Love You,"Maybe I hang around here
A little more than I should
We both know I've got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
But this is pure and simple
And you must realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I love you
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along every day
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you got the chance to say

I love you
I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born in another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours and here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it like this

I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love you"
98,Chicago,Call On Me,"The feeling was clear
Clear as a blue sky on a sunny day
Ev'rything was you: oo
'Cause no one made me feel
The way I felt with you Oh Oh

Call on me 'cause
I love you
You know I do
You love me too oo oo oo

Then came a change
When I said I would soon be leavin' you
Nothin' else to do oo
But please remember I'll never lose the thought of you

Call on me 'cause
I love you
You know I do
You love me too oo oo oo

You've got to find
Someone else to somehow take my place
Share his life with you: oo
But if you need a friend
You can always count on me

Count on me 'cause
I love you
You know I do
You love me too oo oo oo

You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me"
