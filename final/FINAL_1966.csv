1,Sgt. Barry Sadler,The Ballad Of The Green Berets,
2,Association,Cherish,"Cherish is the word that I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you
Into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what seems
To be the life that you could
Cherish as much as I do yours

Oh: I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters: just the right sound
That could make you hear: make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind

Oh: I could say I need you
But then you'd realize that I want you
Just like a thousand other guys who'd say they loved you
With all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face: your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you
Into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do cherish you
And I do cherish you
Cherish is the word"
3,Righteous Brothers,(You're My) Soul And Inspiration,"Girl: I can't let you do this
Let you walk away
Girl: how can I live through this?
When you're all I wake up for each day baby

You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby what good am I?

I never had much going
But at least I had you
How can you walk out knowing
I ain't got nothing left if you do: baby

You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby what good am I?
Oh: what good am I?

Baby: I can't make it without you
And I'm: I'm telling you honey
You're my reason for laughing: for crying
For living and for dying

Baby: I can't make it without you
Please: I'm begging you baby
If you go it will kill me: I swear it
Girl: I just can't bear it

You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby what good am I?
What good am I?

Mmm

8,Supremes,You Can't Hurry Love,"I need love: love
To ease my mind
I need to find: find someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
You got to trust: give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches
Must I stand before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength: yeah
It's almost gone
I remember mama said:

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?

No I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I: I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said:

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
She said trust: give it time
No matter how long it takes

No: love: love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said:

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
She said to trust: give it time
No matter how long it takes

You can't hurry love
No: you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

Do-doo-doo-wah shoo-be-doo-be

How can you tell me
How much you miss me
When the last time I saw you
You wouldn't even kiss me

That rich guy you've been seein'
Must have put you down
So welcome back baby
To the poor side of town

To him you were nothin'
But a little plaything (was a plaything: doo wah)
Not much more than
An overnight fling (overnight fling: doo wah)

To me you were the greatest thing
This boy had ever found
And girl it's hard to find nice things
On the poor side of town

I can't blame you for tryin'
I'm tryin' to make it too
I've got one little hang up: baby
I just can't make it without you (without you: without you)

So tell me
Are you gonna stay now (will you stay now: doo wah)
Will you stand by me girl
All the way now (all the way now: doo wah)

With you by my side
They can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town

(So tell me how much you love me)
(Come be near to me and say you need me now)

Oh: with you by my side
This world can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town

11,Lovin' Spoonful,Summer In The City,"Hot town: summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down: isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around: people looking half dead
Walking on the sidewalk: hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on: come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be all right

And babe: don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer: in the city
In the summer: in the city

Cool town: evening in the city
Dressing so fine and looking so pretty
Cool cat: looking for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Running up the stairs: gonna meet you on the rooftop

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on: come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be all right

And babe: don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer: in the city

12,Roger Williams,Born Free,"Born free: as free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart

Live free and beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
Each time you look at a star

Stay free: where no walls divide you
You're free as the roaring tide
So there's no need to hide

Born free and life is worth living
But only worth living
'Cause you're born free

Born free
Born free
Born free"
13,Nancy Sinatra,These Boots Are Made For Walkin',"You keep sayin' you've got somethin' for me
Somethin' you call love: but confess
You've been a-messin' where you shouldn'ta been a-messin'
And now someone else is gettin' all your best

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
Yeah

You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep losin' when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be a-changin'
Now what's right is right: but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned: ha!
I just found me a brand new box of matches: yeah
And what he knows: you ain't had time to learn

These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Spoken:
Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'!"
14,Jimmy Ruffin,What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted,"As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind: maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me: they come a-tumbling down
Every day: heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows: searching for light
Cold and alone: no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who'll care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind: help me: please

I'm searching: though I don't succeed
For someone's love: there's a growing need
All is lost: there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be lookin' every day
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
And I'll be searching everywhere
I know I'm gonna find it there"
15,Frank Sinatra,Strangers In The Night,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night: two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm: embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight: in love forever
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away
A warm: embracing dance away

Ever since that night: we've been together
Lovers at first sight: in love forever
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night

Doo doo doo de da

16,Beatles,We Can Work It Out,"Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting: my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting: my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out"

20,Percy Sledge,When A Man Loves A Woman,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad: he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well: this man loves you: woman
I gave you everything I have
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby: please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want some other girl
Yes: when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby: baby: baby: you're my world
When a man loves a woman
Know exactly how he feels
Baby: baby: baby"

22,Petula Clark,My Love,"My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky

My love is brighter than the brightest star 
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

Something happened to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind: no matter what I do
And every day it seems I want you more

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky

My love is brighter than the brightest star
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me
Once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
For now I have to tell you everyday

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky

My love is brighter than the brightest star
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky

My love is brighter than the brightest star
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love"

And I'll make up
For all lost time

Sunny one so true: I love you.

Sunny: thank you for that smile upon your face.
Sunny: thank you for that gleam that flows with grace.
You're my spark of nature's fire:
You're my sweet complete desire.
Sunny one so true: I love you."

Dear Sir or Madam: will you read my book?
It took me years to write: will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job: so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer

It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job: but he wants to be a paperback writer

Get out my life: why don't you: baby?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a-coming around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me: hey

Set me free: why don't you: baby?
Let me be: why don't you: baby? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

You just keep me hangin' on (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothing I can do about it

Whoa-whoa-whoa
Set me free: why don't you: baby?
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Get out my life: why don't you: baby? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Set me free: why don't you: baby?
Get out my life: why don't you: baby?

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
Now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else: hey

Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now: you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Go on: get out: get out of my life
And let me sleep at night (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on"

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed: but you
And now you've gone away

Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
And that I have to follow you
And beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me: believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me: I'll never tie you down

Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

If you're rich or poor
Or if you're smart or dumb
A woman's place in this old world
Is under some man's thumb

And if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
You're born to be stepped on
Lied to: cheated on
And treated like dirt

Ah: if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
A woman's lot is to give and give
And go on giving
A woman's got to love and lose
And go on living

Well: I was born a woman
I didn't have no say
And when my man finally comes home
He makes me glad it happened that way
Because to be his woman
No price is too great to pay

Yes: I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way
Oh: I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way"

You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well

Starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah: the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running: never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah: the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah: the worst is over now

What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mowed lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet thing
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream will last long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years

What a day for a daydream
Custom-made for a daydreamin' boy
Now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy"

I saw a girl there she was out of sight
I asked a friend of mine who she could be
He said that her friends just call her Sweet Pea

Oh Sweet Pea come on and dance with me
Come on: come on: come on and dance with me
Oh Sweet Pea won't you be my girl
Won't you: won't you: won't you be my girl

I walked on over and asked her to dance
Thinkin' maybe later we would make a romance
But every guy there was thinkin' like me
I had to stand in line to get a dance with Sweet Pea

Oh Sweet Pea come on and dance with me
Come on: come on: come on and dance with me
Oh Sweet Pea won't you be my girl
Won't you: won't you: won't you be my girl

I finally got to whisper sweet words in her ear
Suggest her that we outta get away from there
We took a little walk I held he close to me
And underneath the stars I said to Sweet Pea

Oh Sweet Pea I love you can't you see
Love you: love you: love you can't you see
Oh Sweet Pea won't you be my girl"

Bus stop: bus goes: she stays: love grows
Under my umbrella

All that summer: we enjoyed it
The wind and rain and shine
That umbrella: we employed it
By August: she was mine

Every morning: I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinkin' of a sweet romance
Beginning in a queue

Came the sun: the ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow

Every morning: I would see her waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop and she would show me what she bought
All the people stared as if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same

Bus stop: wet day: she's there: I say

He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a night so long
When time goes crawlin' by?
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a fallin' star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

Yeah I-I could cry-eye-eye

50,Bob Lind,Elusive Butterfly,"You might wake up some morning
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise you'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears you might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned
It will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dream
With nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name as I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me running
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there that glided past you followed close by heavy breathing

Don't be concerned
It will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dream
With nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Across my dream
With nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love"
51,Simon and Garfunkel,I Am A Rock,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock: I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock: I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well: I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved: I never would have cried
I am a rock: I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room: safe within my womb
I touch no one: and no one touches me
I am a rock: I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"

Hangin' down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms
Lady Godiva

She found fame and made her name
A Hollywood director came into town
And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?""
""You're a girl that could go far""
""'Specially dressed the way you are""
She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake

He directs certificate 'X'
And people now are craning their necks
To see her

One that everybody knows
Finished with the striptease shows

For a poet and a one-man band

Homeward bound

Homeward bound

Home: where my thought's escapin'
Home: where my music's playin'
Home: where my love lies waitin' silently for me

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines: mm
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound

Home: where my thought's escapin'
Home: where my music's playin'
Home: where my love lies waitin' silently for me

Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend: mm-mm
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound

Home: where my thought's escapin'
Home: where my music's playin'
Home: where my love lies waitin' silently for me
Silently for me"
57,Lovin' Spoonful,Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind?,"Did you ever have to make up your mind?
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy: and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Did you ever have to fin'lly decide?
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes: and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to fin'lly decide?

Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes: cute as a bunny
With hair down to here: and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy: and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says ""Better go home son: and make up your mind""
Then you bet you'd better fin'lly decide
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes: and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to fin'lly decide?"

Threw way her wig: and her high sneakers too:
She was doin' a dance without any shoes
She was barefootin': she was barefootin':

Take off your shoes and throw them away:

Seasons came and changed the time
And I grew up: I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang: I shot you down
Bang bang: you hit the ground
Bang bang: that awful sound
Bang bang: I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Now he's gone: I don't know why
And till this day: sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang: he shot me down
Bang bang: I hit the ground
Bang bang: that awful sound
Bang bang: my baby shot me down"

My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight

See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home: yeah: yeah
Well: I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?"
62,Rolling Stones,19th Nervous Breakdown,"You're the kind of person you meet at certain
Dismal: dull affairs
Center of a crowd: talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs

Well: it seems to me that you have seen
Too much in too few years
And though you've tried: you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

You better stop and look around
Here it comes: here it comes
Here it comes: here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

When you were a child: you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night

Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax

You better stop and look around
Here it comes: here it comes
Here it comes: here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

Oh: who's to blame?
That girl's just insane
Well: nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse: oh please

You were still in school when you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind

On our first trip: I tried so hard
To rearrange your mind
But after a while: I realized
You were disarranging mine

You better stop and look around
Here it comes: here it comes
Here it comes: here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

Oh: who's to blame?
That girl's just insane
Well: nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse: oh please

You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality

Now show me a girl
A girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one
With true lovin' every time

Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah: yeah: yeah
And I believe that

Don't judge a book by its cover
She may be fine on the outside

I can feel the heartaches
Comin' on strong.
I can feel the teardrops: the pain: and the sorrow
Ever since you've been gone: they' been
Comin' on strong.

Pain: come on in: hello sorrow:
I see you're back again.
Teardrops: glad you dropped by:
'Cause you can help drown my pride.

And since you're here: time seems just fine:
To let you know that you're gonna be with me
'Til I lose my mind:
But you've been gone:
Much too long and I can feel the heartaches:
Comin' on strong.

Only thing you left me: was misery for company:
And memories of a love gone wrong: that keep
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong"
71,Ray Conniff and The Singers,Somewhere My Love,"Somewhere my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of Spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams: all than your heart can hold
Someday we'll meet again: my love
Someday whenever the Spring breaks through

You'll turn to me out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind: soft as the kiss of snow
Lara: my own: think of me now and then
Godspeed: my love: till you are mine again

Warm as the wind: soft as the kiss of snow
Godspeed: my love: till you are mine again"
72,David Houston,Almost Persuaded,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips: coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

Then she came and sat down at my table
As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered: ""I need you:
Take me away from here and be my man.""

Then I looked into her eyes and saw it
The reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home."
73,Bobby Darin,If I Were A Carpenter,"If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby?

If a tinker were my trade
Would you still find me
Carrin' the pots I made
Followin' behind me?

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I'm given you my onliness
Come give your tomorrow!

If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?
Answer me babe: ""Yes I would
I'll put you above me!""

If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color box
And your soft shoe shining?

If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry anyway?
Would you have my baby?"

And take a message to Michael

In his search to find wealth and fame
I hear Michael has gone and changed his name

It's a year since he wasn't here
Kentucky blue bird: fly away
And take a message to Michael
Message to Michael
Tell him I miss him more each day
As his train pulled out down the track
Michael promised he'd soon be coming back

Oh tell him how my heart just breaks in two
Since he journeyed far
And even though his dream of fame
Fell through
To me he will always be a star

Spread your wings for New Orleans   
Kentucky bluebird: fly away
And take a message to Michael
Message to Michael
Ask him to start for home today
When you find him please let him know
Rich or poor
I will always love him so

Fly away: Kentucky bluebird
Fly away
Fly away ..."

Just to get through it
Once again you'll be mine
I still think we can do it
And you know how much I love you

Woman: don't forsake me
Woman: if you take me then
Believe me I'll take you
To be my woman"
87,Turtles,You Baby,"From the time I fall asleep
'Til the morning comes I dream about
You baby
And I feel all right
'Cause I know tonight I'll be with
You baby
And who makes me feel like smiling
When the weary day is through

You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you
You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you

They say candy is sweet
But it just can't compete with
You baby
You've got everything I need
And nobody can please like
You do: baby
And who believes all my wildest dreams
And my craziest schemes will come true

You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you
You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you

A little ray of sunshine
A little bit of soul
Add just a touch of magic
You got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll

You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you
You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you
You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you
You baby: no one but you: baby: nobody but you"

89,Los Bravos,Black Is Black,"Black is black
I want my baby back
It's grey: it's grey
Since she went away

Oh-oh: what can I do?
'Cause I-I-I-I-I
I'm feelin' blue

If I had my way
She'd be back today
But she don't need time
To see me again

Oh-oh: what can I do?
'Cause I-I-I-I-I
I'm feelin' blue

I can't choose
It's too much to lose
My love's too strong
Maybe she
Would come back to me
What did I do wrong?

Bad is bad
This fella is so sad
It's time: it's time
That I found peace of mind

Oh-oh: what can I do?

And when you're old and grey
You will remember what they said
That two girls are too many
Three's a crowd and four you're dead

Oh Dandy: Dandy
When you gonna give up?
Are you feelin' old now?
You always will be free
And you need no sympathy
A bachelor you will stay

93,Gary Lewis and The Playboys,She's Just My Style,"Every time I see her she don't even look my way
Maybe she will notice me: but then what would I say?
I would say what's on my mind
But the words are hard to find
But I'm gonna try to tell her anyway

Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's just my style
Everything about her drives me wild
Don't you know that she's fine: so fine

Other guys who meet her may not think she's much to see
I can't begin to tell you what she always does to me
Maybe it's the clothes she wears
Or the way she combs her hair
Oh: that makes me want to tell her that I care

Everything about her drives me wild

94,Chris Montez,The More I See You,"The more I see you: the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you and my heart won't try

95,Bobby Fuller Four,I Fought The Law,"A-breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
Well: she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

A-robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and-a good fun
I fought the law and the law won

96,Beatles,Yellow Submarine,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine: yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine: yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine: yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine: yellow submarine

Full steam ahead: Mr. Boatswain: full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is: Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye: sir: aye-aye
Captain: captain

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine: ha-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine: yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine: yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine: yellow submarine

97,Paul Revere and The Raiders,Hungry,"Girl you got this need to know what I'm all about
There was something that you dig you can't figure out
Now you want to know what moves my soul
And what dips inside of my brain
Well I got this need I just can't control
And it's driving me insane

I can't take it: ow: because I'm
Hungry for those good things baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life baby
With a real fine girl like you
I can almost taste it baby
And it's sweet as wine

There's a custom-tailored world that I want to own: someday
With a special place of hiding we can stay alone: you and me
Girl I'm gonna' have it all someday if you'll just hang on to my hand
If I break some rules along the way: you gotta' understand
It's my way of gettin' what I want now: 'cause I'm hungry

Well I ain't gonna' waste it now
When it's finally mine
Gonna' live each minute: bill the often days
Till I've had my fill: ah girl I'll be rollin' in it
Yes: yes you know I will: yes I will: wah!

I can't take it: ow: because I'm
Hungry for those good things baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life baby
With a real fine girl like you

99,Yardbirds,Shapes Of Things,"Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow: will I be older?
Come tomorrow: maybe a soldier
Come tomorrow: will I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?
Fall into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow: will I be older?
Come tomorrow: maybe a soldier
Come tomorrow: will I be bolder than today?

Soon I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind"
