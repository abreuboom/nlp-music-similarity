2,TLC,Waterfalls,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam: she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much

But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little Precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is: ""Baby it's good to me.""

One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Ya'll don't hear me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries

My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps em' in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine into your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane
And name this day and time
For fallin' prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast"

(Creep) Oh I: oh I: oh I yeah

The 22nd of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me

I look him in his eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection: oh

So I creep: yeah
I just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep: yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh: so I creep

The 23rd of lonliness
And we don't talk like we use to do
Now it seems pretty strange
But I'm not buggin'
'Cause I still feel the same yeah: yeah

I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected: oh

So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do"
4,Seal,Kiss From A Rose,"There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea:
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know: that when it snows:
My eyes become large: and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby: I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray:
Ooh: the more I get of you: the stranger it feels: yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom:
A light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you: so much he can say
You remain my power: my pleasure: my pain
Baby: to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny:
Won't you tell me: is that healthy: baby?

But did you know that when it snows:
My eyes become large: and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby: I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray:
Ooh: the more I get of you: the stranger it feels: yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom:
A light hits the gloom on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I'm kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby: the stranger it feels: yeah
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
And if I should fall: would it all go away?
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby: I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you: so much he can say
You remain my power: my pleasure: my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny:
Won't you tell me: is that healthy: baby?

But did you know that when it snows:
My eyes become large: and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby: I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray:
Ooh: the more I get of you: the stranger it feels: yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom:
A light hits the gloom on the gray

Yes: I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray:
Ooh: the more I get of you: the stranger it feels: yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom:
A light hits the gloom on the gray

5,Boyz II Men,On Bended Knee,"And I...

Darlin' I: I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again: until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you: begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again: until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby: I'm sorry.
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl.
I know you put all your trust
In me: I'm sorry I let you down.
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers: the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe: in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees: begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again: until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee"
6,Real McCoy,Another Night,"Another night: another dream: but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night: another dream: but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

Just another night: another vision of love
You feel joy: you feel pain: 'cause nothing will be the same
Just another night: it's all that it takes to understand
The difference between lovers and fakes

In the night: in your dreams of love so true
I talk: talk: I talk to you

In the night: in my dreams: I'm in love with you

Just another night: another dream: another vision of love
With me: I'm here to set you free
I am your lover: your brother: hey sister let me cover
Your body with my love: as with my love in just another
Vision of love that seems to be true
Oh we do all the things that only lovers do
Vision of love that seems to be true
Oh we do all the things that only lovers do

In the night: in my dreams: I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do

7,Mariah Carey,Fantasy,"When you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Baby: I'm so into you
Darling: if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet: sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet: sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you go into my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

Sweet: sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet: sweet fantasy baby

It's just a sweet...
Sweet: sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet: sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but
I'm not sleeping

Sweet: sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet: sweet fantasy baby (x2)

8,Madonna,Take A Bow,"Take a bow: the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low: the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here: there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around (no one around)
Watching you: watching me: one lonely star
(One lonely star you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted: why oh why
The show is over: say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye): say goodbye

Make them laugh: it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile: all the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)

Wish you well: I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played (role that you played)
No more masquerade: you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted: why oh why
The show is over: say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye): say goodbye

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted: why oh why
The show is over: say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye): say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye bye): say goodbye

All the world is a stage (world is a stage)
And everyone has their part (has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
(You'd break: you'd break: you'd break)
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted: why oh why
The show is over: say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye): say goodbye
Say goodbye"
9,Monica,Don't Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days),"It's just one of them days: when I wanna be all alone
It's just one of them days: when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days: don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone: and you think I treat you wrong

I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave
And baby trust me please

Just one of them days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong

Don't take it personal
Baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal

I sit and I think about every thing we do
And I find myself in mysery and that ain't cool
Hey now: I really want to be with you the whole way through
But the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back from mood to mood it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me boy
So baby don't you leave

Chorus 2x's

Hook 2x's w/ variations

Don't take it personal baby
Personal baby: personal baby
Personal baby: personal baby
Personal baby"
10,Montell Jordan,This Is How We Do It,"This is how we do it
(This is how we do it)
La la la la 
La la lo lo lo lo oh
(This is how we do it)
La la la la oh

This is how we do it: it's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side

So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say: ""Monty: yo we made it!""

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

You gotta get your groove on
Before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flava (this is how we do it)
Let's flip the track: bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

This is how we do it: all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa

You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G: the girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

Whatever it is: the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed: it's all because (this is how we do it)
Ooh South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flava (this is how we do it)
Let's flip the track: bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed: it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does: nobody does (this is how we do it)
YNV: SCC:  (this is how we do it) all my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track  (this is how we do it)
Check it out

Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6'8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good

There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty: this is what he said
""You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash.""

Oh I'm buzzing because  (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does  (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava  (this is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track  (this is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed: it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does: nobody does  (this is how we do it)
Oh it's party time  (this is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the west side  (this is how we do it)

OG's got the flava: yeah  (this is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does it  (this is how we do it)
Come on now: Def Jam: you know what it  (this is how we do it)
This is how we do it (this is how we do it) baby"

And we don't even know what we argue about

Some people work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's not wait 'til the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it: baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well: maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away

Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry (no: no: baby)
We might watch our whole lives pass us by (we might wait our whole lives)
Let's not wait 'til the water runs dry

I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has got to deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cause it's all about the dog in me

I want a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret: everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing
'Cause I will be a freak
Until the day until the dawn
And we can (pump: pump)
All through the night to the early morn
Come on and I will take you
Around the hood on a gangsta lean

Any time of day it's all good for me

Boy: you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up
Now there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do

I'm packing all the flavor you need
I got you shook up on your knees

I want a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me just for me

14,Blues Traveler,Run-Around,"Oh: once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah: humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek: so shall we find
And when you're feeling open: I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there: I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing: ""Hey babe: let's keep in touch
Hey baby: let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch: I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky: we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine: the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme: so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la: bombardier: this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure: the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah: I will drink in and always be full

Oh: I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well: all right: okay: so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Oh: you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?"
15,All-4-One,I Can Love You Like That,"They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day a prince charming would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way it felt when romeo kissed juliette
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance: I can love you like that

I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
Forever's what I mean
Well I am no casanova
But I swear this much is true:
I'll be holding nothing back
When it comes to you
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes...

I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance: I can love you like that

If you want tenderness
I've got tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
If you want a man
Who will understand
You don't have to look very far

I can love you: girl I can (I can love you love you)
Oh baby oh...
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I can love you like that
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
Show you you're everything (you're everything to me)
Love you like that
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
Show you you're everything"
16,Bryan Adams,Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?,"To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really: really ever loved a woman?

To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really: really ever loved a woman?

Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - Ya gotta treat her right
She will be there for you: takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman: yeah

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know you really love a woman

When you love a woman

17,Bon Jovi,Always,"This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see: I've always been a fighter
But without you: I give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well: I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby: that's just me

And I will love you: baby: always
And I'll be there forever and a day: always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die: you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you: always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh: some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips: to hold you near
When you say your prayers: try to understand
I've made mistakes: I'm just a man

When he holds you close: when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby: always
And I'll be there forever and a day: always

If you told me to cry for you: I could
If you told me to die for you: I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well: there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you: baby: always
And I'll be there forever and a day: always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die: you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you: always

Always: always"

19,Nicki French,Total Eclipse Of The Heart,"Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

But now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
A total eclipse of the heart
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark

A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do

21,Michael Jackson,You Are Not Alone,"Another day has gone: I'm still all alone
How could this be: you're not here with me
You never said goodbye: someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself: how did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone: I am here with you
Though you're far away: I am here to stay
You are not alone: I am here with you
Though we're far apart: you're always in my heart
You are not alone
Alone: all alone: why: alone

Just the other night: I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers: your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand: then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself: how did love slip away
Then something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone: I am here with you
Though you're far away: I am here to stay
You are not alone: I am here with you
Though we're far apart: you're always in my heart
You are not alone

Oh: whisper three words and I'll come running: darling
And: girl: you know that I'll be there: I'll be there

That you are not alone: I am here with you
Though you're far away: I am here to stay
You are not alone: I am here with you
Though we're far apart: you're always in my heart

That you are not alone: I am here with you
Though you're far away: I am here to stay
For you are not alone: for I am here with you
Though we're far apart: you're always in my heart
For you are not alone

You are not alone: you are not alone
Said again: you are not alone: you are not alone
Not alone: not alone
Did you raise for me: girl
In the morning: in the evening
Not alone: not alone: you and me: not alone

26,Hootie and The Blowfish,Let Her Cry,"She sits alone by a lampost
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says ""Dad's the one I love the most:
But Stipe's not far behind""

She never lets me in
Only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I said that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God: you gotta help me fly away
And just

Let her cry: if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing: if it eases all her pain
Let her go: let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow: let her be
Let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying ""baby: maybe I'll be back someday""
I wanted to look for you
You walked in; I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer
And felt sorry for myself: sayin'

Let her cry: if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing: if it eases all her pain
Let her go: let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow: let her be
Let her be

Let her cry: if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing: if it eases all her pain
Let her go: let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow: let her be
Ah...

Last night: I tried to leave
Cried so much: I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried: yellin'
""Oh mama: please help me!
Won't you hold my hand and...?""

Let her cry: if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing: if it eases all her pain
Let her go: let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow: let her be
Let her cry: if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing: if it eases all her pain
Let her go: let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow: let her be
Oh: let her be."
27,Blessid Union Of Souls,I Believe,"Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Violence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street
And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

But I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Ooh

I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year
She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear
That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love
With a nigger from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me
'Cause she believes that love will see it through
And one day he'll understand
And he'll see me as a person and not just a black man

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe I believe I believe I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
Love will find the way (x7)"

Would you be man enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise: I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave"
31,Vanessa Williams,Colors Of The Wind,"You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life: has a spirit: has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew: you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grin
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle: in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow
If you cut it down: then you'll never know

Oh: and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or whether we are white or copper skin
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind
You can own the earth and still: all you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colours of the wind"
32,Jon B.,Someone To Love,"Don't even like to think about it
I don't know what I'd do without it
I only know that I live and breathe for your love
Baby you came to me
In my time of need
When I needed you: you were there for me
Baby the love from you is what got me through
It's because of you: I was able to
Give my heart again: you gave me

Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know

I thought I'd never love again
I thought my life was over and
I didn't want to face or even see another day
Suddenly from no where: baby you appeared
You dried my tears: you cared for me
Maybe your love for me: truly rescued me
It's because of you: I was able to
Fall in love again: you gave me

Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know

For so long in my life: I wouldn't let love inside
But I swallowed my pride the day you arrived
Now that you're by my side
Everything is all right
It's because of you: I was able to
Give my heart again: you gave me

Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to touch
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know
Someone to love
Someone to trust
Someone to hold
Oh someone to know"
33,Hootie and The Blowfish,Only Wanna Be With You,"You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me
When I look at other girls

Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby
'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

Only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
Only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up and blue
Only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Ooohooo
Ooohooohooo

I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
I want a love that is based on truth not just dare

You will not hurt my pride

So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down

But if you want my heart

35,Martin Page,In The House Of Stone And Light,"O Mount Kailas
Uncover me
Come my restoration
Wash my body clean
I've been walking
Along a crooked path
Where the walls have fallen
And broken me in half

I'm telling you
I will not rest till I lay down my head
I'm gonna go
In the house of stone and light
I shall not cry for the blind man I leave behind
When I got
In the house of stone and light
In the house of stone and light

Holy lady
Show me my soul
Tell me of that place
Where I must surely go
Old man waiting
At the gates for me
Give me the wisdom
Give me the key

I'm telling you
I will not rest till I lay down my head
In the house of stone and light
I make my way O gonna be such a beautiful day
In the house of stone and light
In the house of stone and light

Let me in beneath my skin
In the house of stone and light

It's been too long
My spirit's been at war
Havasupai Shaman
Let me be reborn

All I will embrace the sun upon my face
Come the day I awake the child inside
In the house of stone and light
And when I go I will op-op-open my eyes
In the house of stone and light
I will see you
In the house of stone and light

I'm looking in beneath my skin
In The House of Stone And Light"
36,Luniz,I Got 5 On It,"Creep on it: on it...
See I'm ridin' high: high...
Kinda broke it seem to y'all
So all I got is five: I got five


Playa: give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies: spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it but it ain't enuff on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s
Never the less I'm hella fresh rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like Ping Pong
I'm gone: beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on: wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie: fools all kick in like Shinobi
No: me ain't no homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' it at my friend hit-bit
Unless you pull out the phat crispy
Five dollar bill on the real: before it's history
Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
An if you let 'em hit it for free You hella ""dum-du-dum-dum""
I come to school with the taylor on my earlobe
Avoidin' all the thick teasers: skeezers and weirdos
That be blowin' off the land like ""Where tha bomb at?""
Give me two bucks: you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a slurpy: the serious
Bomb will make a nigga go delirious
Like Eddie Murphy. I got more growin' pains than Maggie
Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it: got it good
Grab your 4-0: let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' wit that Indo weed
I got five on it *got it good*
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Potna: let's go half on a sac


I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don't need no crutch: I'm so keyed up so the joint be burnin' my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand: bra
Hoochies can hit: but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
'Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no: you better bring your own spliff: chief
What's up: don't babysit that: better pass the
Joint: stop hittin': cause you know you got Asthma
Crack the 40 open: homie
And guzzle it: 'cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed: 'cause I done smoked major weed: bro
And every time we with Chris that fool rollin' up a fattie
But the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it *got it good*
Grab your 4-0: let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' wit that Indo weed
I got five on it *got it good*
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it *got it good*
Potna: let's go half on a sac


Ay: make this right: man: stop at the light: man
My yesternight thang got me hung off the night train
You fade: I face: so let's head to da east
Hit the stroll to 9-0: so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth: but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two door Cutlass: same ole' bucket
Foggy windows: soggy Indo
I'm in the land gettin' smoked with my kinfolk


Been smoked - Yuk'll spray ya: lay ya down
Up in the OAK the Town: homies don't play around: we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up: speed up through the ESO Drink the VSOP up
With a lemon squeezer
And everybody's rolled up: I'm da roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a buncha sticky dosia
Hold up: suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed: 'cause where I be's we need tab like a foo-foo

I got five on it *got it good*
Grab your 4-0: let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' wit that Indo weed
I got five on it *got it good*
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it *got it good*

How you make me feel

I can't hold it inside

39,Sophie B. Hawkins,As I Lay Me Down,"It felt like spring time on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though i am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot: barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Oh: darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why (ooh la kah koh)

when the sun comes out again (ooh la kah koh)
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again oh
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again mmh (ooh la kah koh)

I will wake up happy (ooh la kah koh)

40,Mokenstef,He's Mine,"He might be doing you
But he's thinking about me
So baby: think about another lover
And go find another brother

I know he's my man
He's all in my hands
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same?

Feeling discussed: working your stuff
Till he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why 'cause he's mine

Tell you something
That just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you

I wouldn't waste my time
Telling something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(You can't sleep at night)

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(Don't try to dry your eyes)

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(I got him all the time)

Went out on a date
Wasn't out too late
Took you to a room
And you gave it up too soon

Played you like a trick
'Cause you let him hit
Now he's coming home to a lover
That is strong

I got all his love: baby: don't try to take it
You wanted a piece: you were mistaken
'Cause he belongs to me
Baby: can't you see?

I tell you that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you

I wouldn't waste my time
Telling you something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(He's mine)

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(He's mine)

We don't have time
Playing these games
You had him once
But it's me on his mind

No need to cry
Go dry your eyes
Get over it
It was only for one night: oh

He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time: oh
(He's mine)

He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time: oh

I got razors a rippin'
And tearin' and strippin'

And some other woman is lookin' like something
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her
'Til the screaming is gone
Go on believe her
When she tells you
""Nothing's wrong""

But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you

The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please baby: can't you see I'm trying to explain
I've been here before
And I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again

Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow
And wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on and hold her
'Til the screaming is gone
Go on believe her
When she tells you
""Nothing's wrong""

But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you

Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
The back of the club sipping Mo&#xEB;t is where you'll find me
The back of the club: macking hoes: my crew's behind me
Mad question asking: blunt passing: music blasting: but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep wit'
Sleep with: keep the ep a secret: why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie: I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy: I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers: true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over: tell your friends jump in the GS3

Who they attracting with that line: ""What's your name: what's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine: I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are: who you be with
Things that make you smile: what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew: you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave: throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front: and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly: go fill my belly
A T-bone steak: cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few: 'cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do: ain't that right boo? (True)
Forget the telly: we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the Jacuzzi: smoke L's while you do me

Givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote Gats strapped with infrared beams
Chopping O's: smoking la in Optimos
Money: hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever

However living better now: Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's: I'm the man: girlfriend

Now my life is just a rainy day

And I love you so
How much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories
Seem to keep haunting me
Another love: so true
That once turned all my gray skies blue

But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Soaked with love
All my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone
I just don't know what to do

If only you were here
You wash away my tears
The sun would shine
And once again you'll be me mine: oh: mine

But in reality
You and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

Girl: I don't know what I did
To make you leave me but what I do know
Is that since you've been gone
There's such an emptiness inside me
I'm wishin' you would come back to me

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd me mine: oh: mine

But in reality
You and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me: ah baby
You took your love away from me"
49,Brandy,I Wanna Be Down,"I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for:
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me;
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

And if I don't let you know: then I won't be for real
I could be wrong: but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true:
There ain't no other: for me there's only you

I wanna be down: with what you're going through
I wanna be down: I wanna be down with you
No matter the time: of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact: then I'll be more than you ever could dream of

If all you need is the time: that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love: until you call me baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

Yeah oh
Yeah: oh"

51,2Pac,Dear Mama / Old School,"You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school: scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys: breakin all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama: when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused: it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Hey: I'd see the penitentiary
One day: runnin from the police: that's right
Mama catch me: put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend: mama
You always was a black queen: mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it? 
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady: don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady: place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady: don't ya know we love ya

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin for a father: he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin home after work: late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
You're just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough: you're alone
Tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady: don't ya know we love ya (and dear mama)
Sweet lady: place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady: don't ya know we love ya

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy: there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret: always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night: there's a brighter day
Everything will be all right if you hold on
It's a struggle: everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady: don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady: place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady: don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)

Sweet lady
Lady (dear mama)
Lady
Lady"
52,Jamie Walters,Hold On,"I don't wanna see you ever sad and everything that I've got you can have
When it's all too much
You need some human touch to see it's really not so bad

Did you call on every saint you know
But still you feel like you're on your own
Can you see through your tears?
I will always be here and you're not out there baby: all alone

Hold on: till you feel a little stronger. Hold on to me
Hold on: everything's gonna be all right. Just hold on to me tonight

Anything that hurts you hurts me too
I'm not gonna let your world turn blue
Will you take my hand and feel how close I am
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you

I know the world can drive you to your knees: but when you need to cry
Baby: cry to me"
53,Dr. Dre,Keep Their Heads Ringin',"(Ha Ha)
Yeah. What up: this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on (Ha)
Thank God it's Friday. Now

Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu-Boo-ya-cachad
Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu-Boo-ya-cachad
Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu-Boo-ya-cachad
Bu-Bu-Bu-Bu-Boo-ya-cachad

Keep their heads ringin'

Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong
Uh yeah

Hey you: sittin' over there (say what)
You better get up outta your chair (that's right)
And work your body down (yeah)
No time to funk around 'cause we goin'

Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on
And get your groove on
It's the D-R-E: the spectacula'
In a party: I go for your neck
So call me Dracula
As I drain a victim's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains
So don't complain: just chill
Listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real
Enables me to make another mill
Still brothers run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple
So call me Clearasil
I wipe fools off the face of the earth
Since birth: I've been a bad honey
So let me tell ya what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomba
I cause drama: the enforcer
Music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet: never forget
I'm the brother that keeps the girls' panties wet
The mic gets smoked
Once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky: they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The one and only D-R-E
And you know I keep their heads ringin'

Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong

One: two for the crew
Three: four for the dough
Five for the host
Six: seven: eight for Death Row
Mad brothers bout to feel the full effect
Of intellect: so I can collect respect
Plus a check
Now I'm fend to got end to my men: too
To take of this business I need to attend to
'Cause my rent's due
And the rap gang's my meal ticket
So you goddamn right: I'm a kick it
Or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova runnin' brothers over like Christine
When I rock the spot
With the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass: so call me an astronaut
As I blast pass another brother's ass who thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass: just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow fools: know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mike
And flip my tongue like a dike
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The one and only D-R-E
And you know I keep their heads ringin'

Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

Debonair with flair
I scare wear and tear
Without a care
Runnin' things: as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician
No competition
Sendin' all opposition
To see a mortician
I'm up front: never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top
Your rhymes sounds like you bought 'em at stop-n-go
Dre came to wax you: so just call me Mop-N-Glo
Many try to: but just can't rock wit
I'm six-one: two twenty-five of pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin' me are slim: G
'Cause I rock from summer 'til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho: ho: ho: and so as I continue to flow
'Cause: yo: I'm just a fly Negro so
Check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The one and only D-R-E
And I gots to keep their heads ringin'

Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong

Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong
I keep their heads ringin'
Ring ding dong ring a ding ding dong"

55,Del Amitri,Roll To Me,"Look around your world: pretty baby
Is it everything you'd hoped it'd be?
The wrong guy: the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
Roll to me

And look into your heart: pretty baby
Is it aching with some nameless need?
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Right then: roll to me

And I don't think I have ever seen
A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

So don't try to deny it: pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining: it's the
Right time to roll to me
Roll to me
Roll to me

And I don't think I have ever seen
A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

So look around your world: pretty baby

The wrong guy: the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me

Making all your wacky wishes come true

Hello

I wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a 64' Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi: 'cause she don't know me: but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go and even in my dreams I can scheme a way to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball: so how am I gonna compete with that
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood: black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat: skittle: scabobble
Got hit with a bottle and I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach overcommeth
By the thoughts of me and her together: right?
So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

I wish I was little bit taller: I wish I was a baller:
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her

And a 64' Impala

I wish I had a brand-new car: so far I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go: yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car: I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat: but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really whack
See I can't even get a date: so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night with the hood rats you can hold tight: but really tho'
I 'm a figaro when I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
'Cause it's hard to survive
When your livin' in a concrete jungle and These girls just keep passin' me by
She looks fly: she looks fly
Makes me say my: my: my

You could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games: name my kids ghetto names
Little Mookie: Big Al: Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should notice how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See I go simple: I go easy: I go greyhound
Hey: you: what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah: yes: ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like dat

59,Elton John,Believe,"I believe in love: it's all we got
Love has no boundaries: costs nothing to touch
War makes money: cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators: politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love: I believe in love

I believe in love: it's all we got
Love has no boundaries: no borders to cross
Love is simple: hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love: I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love

I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love"
60,Natalie Merchant,Carnival,"Well I've walked these streets
A virtual stage it seemed to me
Makeup on their faces
Actors took their places next to me

Well I've walked these streets
In a carnival of sights to see
All the cheap thrill seekers
The vendors and the dealers they crowded around me

Have I been blind
Have I been lost inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen

Well I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet that they just rolled out for me

And I've walked these streets
In the madhouse asylum they can be
Where a wild eyed misfit prophet on a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me

Have I been blind
Have I been lost inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen

Have I been wrong
Have I been wise to shut my eyes and play along
Hypnotized paralyzed by what my eyes have found
By what my eyes have seen
What they have seen

Have I been blind
Have I been lost have I been wrong
Have I been wise have I been strong
Have I been hypnotized mesmerized
By what my eyes have found

In that great street carnival
In that carnival"

62,Take That,Back For Good,"I guess now it's time: 
For me to give up:
I feel it's time:
Got a picture of you beside me:
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup:
Oh yeah:
Got a fist of pure emotion:
Got a head of shattered dreams:
Gotta leave it: 
Gotta leave it all behind now:

Whatever I said: whatever I did I didn't mean it:
I just want you back for good:
(want you back: want you back: want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it:
You'll be right and understood:
(want you back: want you back)
I want you back for good:

Unaware but underlined: 
I figured out the story: 
(no no)
It wasn't good:
(no no)
But in the corner of my mind:
(corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory:
But that was not to be:
In the twist of separation: 
You excelled at being free:
Can't you find: 
(can't you find)
A little room inside for me:

Whatever I said: whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good: 
(want you back: want you back)
You see I want you back for good:
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it:
You'll be right and understood:
(want you back: want you back)
I want you back for good:

And we'll be together: 
This time is forever:
(forever)
We'll be fighting and forever we will be:
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again:

Whatever I said: whatever I did I didn't mean it:
I just want you back for good:

Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it:
You'll be right and understood:

You see I want you back for good:
Whenever I'm wrong I'll tell you:
Want you back: I want you back for good:

67,Sheryl Crow,All I Wanna Do,"Hit it

This ain't no disco
And it ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me outta nowhere

It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life

And we are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash

And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars
On their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing
As best they can
In skirts and suits

They drive their
Shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company
The record store too
Well: they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

And he shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match
In an over-sized pack
Letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise: the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard"

70,Bon Jovi,This Ain't A Love Song,"Should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should have listened when you said: ""Goodnight""
You really meant goodbye
Baby: ain't it funny: how I never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are 'Know it all's' and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried there were nights that I died for you: baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy: baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong: yeah I'm wrong: this ain't a love song

Baby: I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades: some things never change

It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us: baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had: ain't worth saving

If the love that I got for you is gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong: yeah I'm wrong: this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feelin' so strong is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong: yeah I'm wrong: this ain't a love song

I cried and I cried there were nights that I died for you: baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy: baby

If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong: yeah I'm wrong: this ain't no love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong is the reason I'm holdin' on

Gotcha: open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday"" --> Slick Rick

(Verse One: Lil' Caesar)

Check it out: uh
Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot?
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin and dabbin shit
I make it happen: you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire: from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P.: what if you see: then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan grit ya teeth: g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray: my killings: be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click: thick like Luke dancers
Niggaz grab your gats: bitches take a glance at

Stack the green: read all between the lines
A nigga act up: makes the bastard hard to find

(How ya livin' Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin' down Billy Badasses: cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class: bet I pass it
Shit get drastic: I'm buryin ya bastards
Big Poppa never softenin
Take you to the church: rob the preacher for the offerin
Leave the fucker coughin up blood: and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covered the wife: kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear: Moschino on my bitches
She whippin my ride: countin' my one's: thinkin' I'm richest
Just the way players play: all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin niggaz since Run and them was singin' 'Here We Go'
Snatchin ropes at the Roxie homeboy you didn't know
My flow: detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self: I have son ridin' shotgun
My mind's my nine: my pen's my Mac-10
My target: all you wack niggaz who started rappin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo: niggaz know the half
Caviar for breakfast: champagne bubble baths
Runnin' up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch: who the fuck it was supposed to be?

(Verse Three: Lil' Kim)

I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's: watch my niggaz backs
Nines in the stores: glocks in the bags
Maxin mini-markets: gettin' money with the Arabs
No question: confession: yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits: niggaz grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals: excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the rilli with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y: oh my: I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin' nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
'Cause they all in line screamin one more time
Niggaz: grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club: straight up"

Lyrically splittin dismissin
I'm on a mission of just hitting
Now it's written and kitten hittin wit mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn: you nerd man: you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
Full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys: I'm rowdy really

1-So here we go now:
Holla if ya hear me though: come and feel me flow

Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixins that ain't fittin to be hittin.
On nothin' splittin things that's bitten
And gettin' written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye.
(Rpt 1: 1)

The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's
The wetter flow that'son point like
Decimals manhandlin new crews
Partying with the Zoo Crew
Looking for the pink in poo poo.
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jammin ta while we plannin ta jam
We bust plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin damagin mics
Men and even mannequins.
You're a fan again now I wanna know whose the man again?
Naughty's back like vertibrates word to hey-a-ho
The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang
(Rpt 1: 1)

Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up get up
Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up.
Shakes shows until they fizz up
RZA like you're with us if not zip up
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back 'cause we heard
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty I'm Naughty.

It just keep getting better

75,Vanessa Williams,The Sweetest Days,"You and I in this moment: holding the night so close
Hanging on still unbroken: while outside the thunder rolls

Listen now: you can hear our heart beat
Warm against life's bitter cold... these are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me: that rattle the house like wind
Both of us so unbending: we battle the fear within
All the while: life is rushing by us hold it now and don't let go
These are the days: the sweetest days we'll know

So we whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars till they're gone
And when even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on

Listen now you can hear our heartbeat
Hold me now and don't let go
These are the days
Every day is the sweetest day we'll know

The sweetest days we'll know"

77,Brandy,Brokenhearted,"I'm young but I'm wise
Enough to know that you
Don't fall in love over night
That's why I thought if I
Took my time that everything
In love would be right
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was sayin' to love Goodbye

But I guess I'm
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

No more empty conversation
Next time I will be totally sure
Don't want the pain of falling
In and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure
So I listen to all the advice
And remember each time I cry

But I guess I'm
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

While I'm lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
Da Da Da
Oh Ya
Da Da Da Da Da
Wow Ya
A Da: Ooh

I listen to all the advice
And remember each time I cry

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over"

I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see

Oh: but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

No more ""I love you's""
The language is leaving me
No more ""I love you's""
Changes are shifting outside the words

(The lover speaks about the monsters)

I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire: despair: desire
So many monsters

Oh: but now
(I don't find myself bouncing around
Whistling my consence to make me cry)

No more ""I love you's""
The language is leaving me
No more ""I love you's""
The language is leaving me in silence

No more ""I love you's""

But we will only come
And you know what mommy?
Everybody was being real crazy

The monsters are crazy
There are monsters outside)

Thinking it's all right to let me down

(I remember)
I remember the way you used to love me
(Baby I remember the way)
I remember the days you used to love me
(Oh you used to love me)

I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time

You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around: stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away
(Repeat first verse)

Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real

You didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day
Now your love has gone away
I remember I remember

Oh baby you used to walk holding my hand
'Cause you used to be my man

Is love in the air
Or is it all in my mind

Living like a tart

You're a star

You don't have to go blind

You just know you want out
Believing in yourself
Almost as much as you doubt

You're a big smash
You wear it like a rash
Star

Oh no: don't be shy
There's a crowd to cry
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me

Hey: oh oh

They want you to be Jesus
They'll go down on one knee
But they'll want their money back
If you're alive at thirty-three

And you're turning tricks with your crucifix
You're a star: oh child

Of course you're not shy
You don't have to deny love
Hold me

Kiss me

I wanna chill
On sugar hill
AZ's for real
He's for real

At times I went to watch out the Marriot
Zoning on owning co-ops: foreign drop-top: coups and yachts
Guzzling straight shots-a scotch:
Formulating up plots ta escape from Salems lock 'cause it's scorching hot
Making it hard trying ta figure who's out ta trap me: Pataki
Got all kinds of undercovers who's coming at me
Perhaps he: won't be happy: till they snatch me
And place me where half the slacks be: sitting in Catsaki
But never me: see: my destiny ta be forever free
In ecstasy on a hill that awaits for me
So plus: just ta visualize is like a coke rush:
Vivid enough ta make living this a must: plus this is real

(Sugar hill: baby. Sugar hill: baby. Ay yo: son: pull the shades down and let's count this money. Put the Grant's in the safe 'cause we spending the Jackson's. The Washington's go to wifey: ya know how we do.)

No more cutting grams: and wrapping grands up in rubberbands: I'm a recovered man
Our plans ta discover other lands
Suburban places got me seeking for oasis
Crystal by the cases: ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised: I'm as determined as them old timers
I wanna villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta treat ya
Laid in the shades of the Everglades: finally forever paid
Wearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team: Caribbean's foreseen
I guess being down for so long I'm all in store ta see my dreams

So until I see past the green pasture
Me being supreme master: ain't much more life ta feind after
But another chapter: a new way of life to adapt ta
'Cause these streets a gas ya: and have ya caught up in the rapture
Deja vu: I could vision my killa crew: more hospitable
Consciously aware plus political
'Cause though they claim that every man created equal
What's his native people: find it harder for nights to sleep through:
But once established we eating lovely: living lavish
Like the house of Versi: Paris: I gotta have it
It's so plus: just ta visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough: ta make living this a must: plus this is real

85,Better Than Ezra,Good,"Looking around the house
Hidden behind the window and the door
Searching for signs of life but there's nobody home

Well: maybe I'm just too sure
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it
Pieces of note fall down: but the letter said: ""Aha

It was good living with you: aha
It was good: ah-aha
It was good living with you: aha
It was good: ah""
Good good good good good good

Sitting around the house
Watching the sun trace shadows on the floor
Searching for signs of life: but there's nobody home

Well: maybe I'll call or write you a letter
Now maybe we'll see on the Fourth of July
But I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud
Well: I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud to say: ""Aha

Now that be how the story goes
Brown Sugar got me open: now I want some more
Always down for a menage troi
But I think I'ma hit it solo
Hope my niggaz don't mind

I gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
You said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done to make you be so rough

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you till your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart?
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel?
I don't understand why you've been so wrong

I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise
So we could get along
I gave my love to you
Despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me: there's only one thing left to say

There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart
It's telling you that something is strained
Ooh girl you don't have to deny it
All you got to do is just try it
You'll find our love will grow stronger if you're willing to change

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you till your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways"

To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up (So cash your checks and get up)


(Verse 2: Bizzy Bone)
Wake up: and I see that my sister was already dressed
She said: ""I'm gonna run and go get my stamps
Watch and make sure no one snatches my check.""
Nigga: that's the mailman; sort through the mail
And put it up in-a me pocket
Then I be hittin' the ninety-nine
To get me a dub for forty duckets
But ain't no bucket
Ride that Rita: hop on the ten to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs: and I cash that dub
Man: I gotta get there
Playa-playa: holla: holla
St. Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-glock for some dollars
So get a bag of dope and a quarter roll: oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke it
Hittin' that reefer: hydro
Been known to cut: so fuck them po-po
Toss all that ye-yo with a bone and say ""Ho""
Runnin' through the alley (And into the malley)
Hop on the second to sundown
Nose run from January: November: December
I'm lovin' the first of the month

(Chorus: Layzie Bone (Bizzy Bone))
Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up (So cash your checks and get up)
Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up (So cash your checks and get up)
Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)

Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up (So cash your checks and get up)

(Verse 3: Wish Bone)
It's the first of the month
Gotta grind: gotta get mine in the hood that I claim
And I slang on the double nine
Now to find them dubs: gonna get a forty
Can a thug get love? What's up?
Try to slang on my corner: nigga: yous a goner
St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies: makin' that money
Come back: nigga: get pap-pap
From the first to the fifteenth niggas smoke plenty weed
But I gotta save: gotta come up
Put my rocks in the cut
When I get high: nigga: blaze that blunt
Time to roll to the pad: count out my profits
And add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back: see: for niggas that's tryin' to rob me: fool
But never no shorts or no losses: dumpin'
Keepin' these niggas up off me
See: the whole block: spend a couple bills
Thugs smoke a lot of weed on the first

(Chorus: Layzie Bone (Bizzy Bone))
Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up (So cash your checks and get up)
Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)

Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up (So cash your checks and get up)

(Verse 4: Layzie Bone (Krayzie Bone))
Wakin' up: feelin' buzzed off early in the morning: stretchin'
I'm yawnin': light-weight bent: chug-a-lug-a
Take a fifth to the dome: 'cause then I can kick it with my trues.
But it is the first: so I'm gettin' me hustle on
Hop on the phone: callin' up Krayzie Bone
""Wanna know: did you're O.G. check come?"" (She put me down)
""I'ma hop on the bus with Biz"" (You know: let's get drunk)
And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of this skunk
Nigga: T: just put me down
Oh: God: how I love when the first come around: now
Me freakin' me black and milds
Head across town: 'cause nigga the first get celebrated
Rushin' to the block: 'cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild: 'cause I'm need me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the first: just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes: the twenties: the fifties
The first be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine: fool
And I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come: come up with them ends
I gotta get paid on the first: gotta blaze up me spliff
You're live with the Bone thugs: Poetic Hustla'z
And the graveyard shift on the first

Wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: wake up: it's the first of the month:
To get up: get up: get up: get up: get up: so cash your checks and come on.

(Chorus: Layzie Bone (Bizzy Bone))

I've built my world around you and I want you to know
I need you: like I've never needed anyone before

I live my life for you
I want to be by your side in everything that you do
And if there's only one thing you can believe is true
I live my life for you

I dedicated my life to you
You know that I would die for you
But our love would last forever
And I will always be with you
And there is nothing we can't do
As long as we're together

I just can't live without you: and I want you to know
I need you like I've never needed anyone before

94,Boyz II Men,Thank You,"I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to (wake up) and see (and see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be: a better way
Say it again: a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me
Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing every where I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sure enough couldn't have survived without you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me"

Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So: if you're mad: get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now

And hey: what you got to hide?
I get angry too
But I'm a lot like you

When you're standing at the crossroads:
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'Cause even if you're wrong
I'll stand by you

I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when: when the night falls on you baby
You're feelin' all alone:
Walkin' on you're own
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

We'll create the cure
We made the disease

Get what you need?
Was it only envy?
So empty

You know my heart is true: oh
I can't stop lovin' you

You change your friends: your place in life: you can change your mind

Oh no: but I think you'll find
That when you look inside your heart: oh baby: I'll be there: yeah

Hold on
I'm holding on
Baby: just come on: come on: come on
I just wanna hear you say

I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true: oh
I can't stop lovin' you

Oh: I'm so twisted and tied
And all I remember
Was how hard we tried
Only to surrender

And when it's over
I know how it's gonna be
And true love will never die
Oh: not fade away

And I can't stop lovin' you
No matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true: oh
