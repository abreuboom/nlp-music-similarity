3,Temptations,I Can't Get Next To You,"Hold it: everybody
Hold it: hold it: listen

I can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh: I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail: huh: on dry land

But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you

Next to you
(I can't get next to you)
I just can't get next you
(I can't get next to you: babe)

I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey: and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh: I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unimportant are all these things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you

(I can't get next to you: babe)
No matter what I do

You better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh: I can change anything from old to new
The thing I want to do the most: I'm unable to do

Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl: you're the key to my happiness
And I can't get next to you

4,Rolling Stones,Honky Tonk Women,"I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme: gimme: gimme the honky tonk blues

First time that I saw you: girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine

And kissed you and my heart began to melt

I need to call a doctor for some help

8,Tom Jones,I'll Never Fall In Love Again,"I've been in love so many times
Thought I knew the score
But now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take anymore

And it looks like
I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love: I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it
Fall in love again

All those things I heard about you
I thought they were only lies
But when I caught you in his arms
I just broke down and cried

And it looks like
I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love: no: I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it: I mean it
Fall in love again

I gave my heart so easily
I cast aside my pride
But when you fell for someone else: baby
I broke up all inside

And it looks like
I'm never gonna fall in love again
That's why I'm a-singin' it
Fall in love: no: I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me

15,Henry Mancini and His Orch.,Love Theme From Romeo And Juliet,
16,Youngbloods,Get Together,"Love is but a song we sing
Fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

Come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Some may come and some may go
He will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass

Come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

If you hear the song I sing
You will understand: listen
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command

Come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

I said come on: people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Right now
Right now"

19,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Proud Mary,"Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin': rollin': rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin': rollin': rollin' on the river

Rollin': rollin': rollin' on the river

If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'

Hands
Touching hands
Reaching out
Touching me
Touching you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I'd be inclined
To believe they never would
But now I

Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holding you

One
Touching one
Reaching out
Touching me
Touching you

Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I'd be inclined
To believe they never would
Oh no: no

Till the stars fall around me and find me alone

I see earthquakes and lightning

There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well: it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Alright!

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

26,Zager and Evans,In The Year 2525,"In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth: tell no lies
Everything you think: do and say
Is in the pill you took today

In the year 4545
Ain't gonna need your teeth: won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you

In the year 5555
Your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do
Some machine is doing that for you

In the year 6565
Ain't gonna need no husband: won't need no wife
You'll pick your son: pick your daughter too
From the bottom of a long glass tube: whoa

In the year 7510
If God's a-comin' he ought to make it by then
Maybe he'll look around himself and say
Guess it's time for the Judgement day

In the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty head then
He'll either say I'm pleased where man has been
Or tear it down and start again: woah woah

In the year 9595
I'm kinda wondering if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing: woah woah

Now it's been 10:000 years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew
Now man's reign is through

But through eternal night
The twinkling of starlight
So very far away
Maybe it's only yesterday

In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may thrive

In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth: tell no lies"

Spinning wheel: all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you: you never learn

Did you find a directing sign on the straight and narrow highway?
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real

Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning wheel spinning through
Drop all your troubles by the riverside
Catch a painted pony on the spinning wheel ride
Ha!

Spinning wheel spinning through
Drop all your troubles by the riverside

My heart can't wait another day
When you touch me: I just got to say

Baby: I love you
Baby: I love you
Baby: I love you
Come on baby: na na na na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)

I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way

Oh: I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name
Tell me baby: that you feel the same

Baby: I love you
Baby: I love you
Baby: I love you
Come on baby: na na na na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
Come on baby: na na na na na na na

Baby: I love you

29,Friends Of Distinction,Going In Circles,"I'm an ever rollin' wheel: without a destination real.
I'm an ever spinning top: whirling around till I drop.
Oh but what am I to do: my mind is in a whirlpool.
Give me a little hope: one small thing to cling to.

You got me going in circles (oh round and round I go)
You got me going in circles
(Oh round and round I go: I'm spun out over you)

I'm a faceless clock: with timeless hopes that never stop.
Lord but I feel that way: of my soul. My soul is stay.
Oh but what am I to do: my mind is in a whirlpool.
Give me a little hope: one small thing to cling to.

You got me going in circles (oh round and round I go)
You got me going in circles
(Oh round and round I go) I'm spun out over you
(I need you baby) over you (I need you baby) spun out over you.

(I need you baby: I need you baby baby)
I'm spun (I need you baby) I said I'm spun out over you (I need you baby)
Spun out over you (I need you baby: I need you baby: I need you baby)"
30,Lettermen,Hurt So Bad,
31,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Green River,"Well: take me back down where cool water flows: y'all
A-let me remember things I love: Lord
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me home
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree: ho
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
Shoo: fly: dragonfly: get back: you mother
Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River
Well!

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days: Lord
With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said: ""You're gonna find the world be smolderin'
And if you get a-lost: come on home to Green River""
Well!

Come on home"

33,Three Dog Night,Easy To Be Hard,"How can people be so heartless
How can people be so cruel
Easy to be hard
Easy to be cold

How can people have no feelings
How can they ignore their friends
Easy to be proud
Easy to say no

Especially people who care about strangers
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the bleeding crowd
How about a needy friend
I need a friend

How can people be so heartless
You know I'm hung up on you
Easy to be proud
Easy to say no

Especially people who care about strangers
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the bleeding crowd
How about a needy friend
We all need a friend

How can people be so heartless
How can people be so cruel

Easy to say no
Easy to be cold
Easy to say no
Much too easy to say no"
34,Smith,Baby It's You,"It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kissed that tears me apart

Many: many: many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do?
Don't want nobody: nobody
'Cause: baby: it's you
Baby: it's you

Is it true what they say about you?
They say you'll never: ever: never be true

It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do?
What 'bout you?
Don't want nobody: nobody
Baby: it's you

35,Elvis Presley,In The Ghetto,"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People: don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks the rules
He buys a gun: steals a car
Tries to run: but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries"
36,Johnny Cash,A Boy Named Sue,"Well: my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now: I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left: he went and named me Sue

Well: he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya: life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well: I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well: it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty: mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold: and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well: I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya: I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well: I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: ""Son: this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah: what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son: I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George: any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!"

Nothing so sad as a tear in vain

He really doesn't deserve you

Is what he has to be yeah

So baby straighten up come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe yeah
I said now baby baby don't cry
Baby baby here's why
Love is here standin' by
Love is here standin' by

You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of

Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realized that tear filled eyes
Can never stop him now no no no
That man is on his way
I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now yeah

Oowee now baby baby don't cry no no
Baby baby here's why
Because love is here standin' by
I say Love is here standin' by

All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have got the love you thought you had in him here in me
Love is hope girl love is strength
Here's someone standin' right beside ya
Who would go to any length to give you love true and deep
And hope you realize at last you found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep

So baby baby don't cry Oh baby don't you cry now
Baby baby don't cry Oh baby let me tell you why now
Baby baby here's why don't you know that
Love is here standin' by
I say love is here standin' by

Your tears are shed in vain I said
So baby baby don't cry c'mon dry your eyes

And the smell of flowers blooming fills the air
Your mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone - that you 
Love; 
Your life is filled with joy when she is there. 

Love can make you happy if you find someone who cares 
To give a life time to you and who has a love to share. 

If you think you've found someone you'll love forevermore: 
Then it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay)
To have: to hold's important when forever is the phrase 
That means the love you've found is going to stay 

Love can make you happy if you find someone who cares 
To give a life time to you and who has a love to share. 

La-love: la-love 

Love can make you happy 
Love can make you happy 
Love can make you happy

Waiting for you to come
Longing to hold you tight
I need you so desperately
Waiting for you to come
Bringing your love to me 

But I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

As life is reality
When you are near to me
I am in ecstasy (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'd swallow the pain and pride
Baby: I just can't hide
All that I feel inside 

And I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

A million years
I would wait for you
A million tears
Baby: I'd be true
A million miles
I would follow you
A million years
If you want me to

Pacing the floor: detest
Sweat pouring down my chest
Still I can't love you less (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
It's worth all the pain and pride
Baby: I just cant hide
All that I feel inside 

And I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)

Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

I didn't notice what time it was
All I know is that I fell in love with you
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you

Every day's a new day in love with you
With each day comes a new way of loving you
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander
And if all my dreams come true
I'll be spending time with you

Oh: I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
I love you more today than yesterday
But: darling: not as much as tomorrow

Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away
Cupid: we don't need ya now: be on your way
I thank the lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger
And I always will be true: I know you feel the same way too

Oh: I love you more today than yesterday
But not as much as tomorrow
I love you more today than yesterday
But only half as much as tomorrow

Every day's a new day: every time I love ya
Every way's a new way: every time I love ya
Every day's a new day: oh: how I love ya"
51,Sammy Davis Jr.,I've Gotta Be Me,"Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong 
Whether I find a place in this world or never belong

What else can I be but what I am  

I want to live: not merely survive 
And I won't give up this dream 
Of life that keeps me alive 
I gotta be me: I gotta be me 
The dream that I see makes me what I am 

That far-away prize: a world of success 
Is waiting for me if I heed the call 
I won't settle down: won't settle for less 
As long as there's a chance that I can have it all 

I'll go it alone: that's how it must be 
I can't be right for somebody else 
If I'm not right for me 
I gotta be free: I've gotta be free 
Daring to try: to do it or die 
I've gotta be me 

I'll go it alone: that's how it must be 
I can't be right for somebody else 
If I'm not right for me 
I gotta be free: I just gotta be free 
Daring to try: to do it or die 
I gotta be me"

53,Donovan,Atlantis,"The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East Africa was a neighbour
Across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is

But a remnant of The Atlantian culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from far Atlantis

Knowing her fate:
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.
On board were the Twelve: 

The poet: the physician
The farmer: the scientist
The magician and the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were -
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice
And let us sing
And dance and ring in the new
Hail Atlantis!

Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be
Way down below the ocean where I wanna be she may be

54,Dennis Yost and The Classics IV,Traces,"Faded photograph: covered now with lines and creases
Tickets torn in half: memories in bits and pieces
Traces of love: long ago that didn't work out right
Traces of love

Things we used to share: souvenirs of days together
The ring he used to wear: pages from an old love letter
Traces of love: long ago that didn't work out right
Traces of love: with me tonight

I close my eyes and say a prayer
That in his heart he'll find a trace of love still there
Somewhere

Traces of hope in the night that he'll come back and dry
These traces of tears from my eyes
Traces of hope in the night that he'll come back and dry
These traces of tears from my eyes"
55,Mama Cass Elliot,It's Getting Better,"Once I believed that when love came to me
It would come with rockets: bells and poetry
But with me and you it just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got

And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday: better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right

And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
'Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger: warm and wilder
Getting better everyday: better everyday
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da

And I don't mind waitin': don't mind waitin'
Cause no matter how long it takes
The two of us know
That it's getting better
Growing stronger: warm and wilder
Getting better everyday: better everyday"

Ah: there's nothing but you
You're frightened and confused
I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say

You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see 'em no more
You wanna hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go

Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mother's voice
'Cause you're lost and alone
But remember you make the choice: oh

Run away child: running wild
Better go back home where you belong
Run away child: running wild
You better go back home where you belong
You're lost in this great big city

Not one familiar face: ain't it a pity

Oh run away child: running wild
You better go back home where you belong

But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
I want my mama

She was twenty-one
When I left Galveston

I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Galveston oh Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun
At Galveston

Carry it home and cook it for supper

Where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

And carry it home in a tote sack

The gators got you granny
(Chomp: chomp: chomp)
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her mama was a-workin' on a chain gang
A wretched: spiteful: straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have mercy: pick a mess of it

Her daddy was lazy and no count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for 
Was stealin' watermelons out of my truck patch

Polk salad Annie
The gators got your granny
(Woo hoo)
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause her mama was a-working on a chain gang

Sock a little polk salad to me
Know I need a mess of it
Ooh: good God
Got to have me"
78,Kenny Rogers and The First Edition,"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town","You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes: it's true: that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh: Ruby
I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age: Ruby: I realize
But it won't be long: I've heard them say: until I'm not around
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

She's leavin' now 'cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby
For God sake's turn around"

Whoa the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean

And they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine

Whoa... ah

La-da da da da da da da
La-da da da da da dee
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play - now

Whoa we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame

Whoa... ah

But neither one will give in
So we gaze at our eight by ten
Thinking 'bout the things that might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

Whoa... ah

La-da da da da da da da
La-da da da da da dee
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play - now

Oh Yeah: ooh-mmm...: oh yeah: come on: come on: come on: come on: come on
Whoa: oh: oh: oh: oh...

Lookie here:
People walking up to you
Singing glory hallelujah - ha ha
And they try and to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord

They're gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope: cheat your fate
And further more to hell with hate
Come on and get on board

Whoa... ah

La-da da da da da da da
La-da da da da da dee
Talking 'bout you and me
And the games people play - now

Now wait a minute...
Look around tell me what you see
What's happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

Whoa... ah

'Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn you back on humanity
Oh!...: and you don't give a da da da da da da da

83,Beatles,Something,"Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know: I don't know
You stick around: now it may show
I don't know: I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how"
