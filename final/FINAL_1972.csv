1,Roberta Flack,The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies: my love

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there at my command: my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last till the end of time: my love

The first time: ever I saw your face
Your face
Your face
Your face"
2,Gilbert O'Sullivan,Alone Again (Naturally),"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make clear to whomever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch 
At a church where people saying 
My God: that's tough: she stood him up
No point in us remaining 

We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again: naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful: bright and gay
Looking forward to: well: who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who: if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?

And in my hour of need
I truly am: indeed
Alone again: naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again: naturally

Now: looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother: God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again: naturally 
Alone again: naturally"
3,Don McLean,American Pie,"A long: long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now: do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well: I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man: I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh: and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry 
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh: but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh: and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on: Jack be nimble: Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh: and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets: the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father: Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin' bye-bye: Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee: but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die"""
4,Nilsson,Without You,"No: I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes: it shows

No: I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there: but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if living is without you
I can't give: I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give: I can't give anymore

Well: I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes: it shows

I can't live if living is without you
I can't give: I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give: I can't give anymore
If living is without you"

7,Bill Withers,Lean On Me,"Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain: we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend: I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Please: swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show

You just call on me: brother: when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend: I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

You just call on me: brother: when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load
You have to bear that you can't carry
I'm right up the road: I'll share your load
If you just call me

Call me (If you need a friend)
Call me (Call me uh-huh)
Call me (When you need a friend)
Call me (If you ever need a friend)
Call me (Call me)
Call me (Call me)
Call me (Call me)

8,Mac Davis,Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me,"Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes
And it's startin' to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me

Just keep it friendly girl
'Cause I don't wanna leave
Don't start clingin' to me girl
'Cause I can't breathe

Baby baby: don't get hooked on me
Baby baby: don't get hooked on me
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free
Baby baby: don't get hooked on me

And it's warm where you're touchin' me
But I can tell by your tremblin' smile
You're seein' way too much in me

Girl: don't let your life
Get tangled up with mine
'Cause I'll just leave you 
I can't take no clingin' vine

9,Melanie,Brand New Key,"I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone: but you got something I need

Well: I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together and try them out you see
I been looking around awhile
You got something for me
Oh! I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key

I ride my bike: I roller skate: don't drive no car
Don't go too fast: but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive
I been all around the world
Some people say: I done all right for a girl

Well: I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together and try them out you see
I been looking around awhile
You got something for me
Oh! I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key

I asked your mother if you were at home
She said: yes ... but you weren't alone
Oh: sometimes I think that you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone: but you've got something I need

Well: I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together and try them out to see
La la la la la la la la: la la la la la la
Oh! I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key"
10,Wayne Newton,Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast,"The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that highway when I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me
Crying

Daddy: don't you walk so fast
Daddy: don't you walk so fast
Daddy: slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy: don't you walk so fast

Now: it broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run to catch a train
She had no way of knowin' I was leavin' home for good
I turned around and there she was again
As she said to me

Daddy: don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried: daddy: don't you walk so fast
Daddy: slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy: don't you walk so fast

If only for the sake of my sweet daughter
I just had to turn back home right there and then
And try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again
She cried and said

Daddy: don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried: daddy: don't you walk so fast
Daddy: slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Oh: daddy: don't you walk so fast

(Daddy: don't you walk so fast)
My daughter cried (Daddy: don't you walk so fast)
Daddy: slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run"

12,Looking Glass,Brandy (You're A Fine Girl),"There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say: ""Brandy: fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say: ""Brandy: you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah: your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said: ""Brandy: you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life: my love and my lady is the sea""

Yeah: Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord: he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say: ""Brandy: you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life: my love and my lady is the sea
It is: yes: it is""

""Brandy: you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life: my love and my lady is the sea
It is: it is: yes: it is"""
13,Chi-Lites,Oh Girl,"Oh: girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how

Oh: girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now: oh

Oh: girl
Tell me: what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl: I feel so out of place: oh: yeah yeah

Don't know where to go: who to see: yeah

Oh: girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl: I've gotta get away from here

Oh: girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
And I don't: I don't know how

Oh: yeah
Oh: girl
Why do I love you so?
Yeah

Better be on my way: I can't stay
Have you ever seen such a helpless man: oh no
Oh girl"
14,Gallery,Nice To Be With You,"Oh: it's so nice to be with you

You're causing commotion in my soul

15,Chuck Berry,My Ding-A-Ling,"When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hanging on a string
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling: oh

My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

You know: then mama took me to Sunday school
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Everytime that choir would sing
Watch me playin' with my ding-a-ling-a-ling: oh

My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

Once I was climbing the garden wall
I slipped and had a terrible fall
I fell so hard: I heard bells ring
But held on to my ding-a-ling-a-ling: oh

My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

Once: I was swimmin' 'cross Turtle Creek
Man: them snappers all around my feet
Sure was hard swimmin' 'cross that thing
With both hands holdin' my ding-a-ling-a-ling: oh

My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

This little song: it ain't so sad
The cutest little song you ever had
Those of you who will not sing
You must be playin' with your own ding-a-ling

My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling: my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

Your own ding-a-ling: your own ding-a-ling 
We saw you playin' with your own ding-a-ling
My ding-a-ling: everybody sing 
I wanna play with my ding-a-ling
I wanna play with my ding-a-ling"

When they took my friend away
I was slippin' into darkness
When they took: when they took my friend away

He know he loves to drink good whiskey
While Laughing at the moon

Slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
I was slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams

Where I talk to my brother
Who never said their name

Slippin' into darkness
All my trouble so I choose
I was slippin' into darkness
All my trouble so I choose

I got a wife and a baby
Now my love hath gained its fame

Slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
I was slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
You've been slippin' into darkness

Pretty soon you gonna pay"
24,Hollies,Long Cool Woman (In A Black Dress),"Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on my West Side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song

A pair of Forty-Fives made me open my knife
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
With a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all: yeah

Woo!

I saw her head out to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
And Charlie said ""I hope that you're able: boy
Hon': I'm telling you she knows where it's at""
Well: suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well: the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well: I told her ""Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared""

I've gotta be forgiving
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
Well: with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all: had it all
Had it all: had it all
Had it all: had it all
Ooh: had it all
Ha: she had it all: yeah"

27,America,A Horse With No Name,"On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see: I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see: I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala..."

To erase all the hurt and tears

Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
But we both know that we can make it

We gotta take life as it comes
And never worry about who's right or wrong
It's an uphill climb to the finish line
We're gonna try to make it one more time

Starting all over again is gonna be rough: so rough

Sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dew fall
On the first grass

Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the One Light
Eden saw play

Praise with elation
Praise every morning
God's recreation
Of the new day

45,Arlo Guthrie,The City Of New Orleans,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central: Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
3 conductors: 25 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey: the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America: how are you
Said don't you know me: I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealing card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point: ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets: made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America: how are you
Said don't you know me: I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis: Tennessee
Halfway home: we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness: rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again: the passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night America: how are you
Said don't you know me: I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done"

They all knew my name
No one recognized me
I didn't look the same

But it's: all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see ya can't please everyone
So ya got to please yourself

People came from miles around
Everyone was there
Yoko brought her Walrus
There was magic in the air

And over in the corner
Much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes
Wearing his disguise

So ya got to please yourself

Lott-in-dah-dah-dah: lot-in-dah-dah-dah

Played them all the old songs
Thought that's why they came
No one heard the music
We didn't look the same

I said hello to Mary Lou
She belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk
It was time to leave

But it's: all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see ya can't please everyone
So ya got to please yourself

And out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell
And lookin' like he should

If you gotta play at Garden parties
I wish you a lot of luck
But if memories were all I sang
I rather drive a truck

'Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer: the flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me: I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe: my chest is a-heaving
Lord have mercy: I'm burning a hole where I lay

Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love (a hunk: a hunk of burning love)
I'm just a hunk: a hunk of burning love
I'm just a hunk: a hunk of burning love

49,Betty Wright,Clean Up Woman,"A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine

Chumpin' slick was my ruin 
'Cause: I found out all I was doin'
Was making it easy for the clean up woman 
To get my man's love: oh yeah
Just making it easy for the clean up woman 
To get my baby's love: uh-huh: um-hum

I took this man's love and put it a shelf 
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself

When you needed love I was out having fun
But I found out that all I had done 
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love: uh-huh 
Yeah: that's what I did: I made it easy for the clean up woman 
To steal my baby's love: oh yeah

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day
The clean up woman: she'll sweep him off his feet  
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street
So take a tip: you better get hip 
To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough 
I mean: she really cleans up"

52,Bread,Everything I Own,"You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm: kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free: set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life: my heart: my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love
What it's of: what it's of
You never said too much 
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give anything I own
Give up my life: my heart: my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give anything I own
Give up my life: my heart: my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to touch you once again"

Soon as you were free

Where is the love?

You told me that you didn't love him
And you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

Where is the love you said was mine all mine
Till the end of time
Was it just a lie
Where is the love

If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hanging on to promises
You've got to let me know

Oh: how I wish I'd never met you
I guess it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait

When you'll see him go

Said goodbye to me

And you don't mess around with Slim"
69,Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,Hot Rod Lincoln,"My pappy said: ""Son: you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true: I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive: just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust:
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes: but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good: tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said: ""Boys: that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind:
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive:
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue: like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said: ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck:
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him: I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said: ""Look out: boys: I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin':
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said: ""Son: you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"""
70,Sonny and Cher,A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done,"Ride: I used to jump my horse and ride
I had a six gun at my side
I was so handsome: women cried
And I got shot but never died

I could play: if I do every thing he'd say
Girls just seem to get in his way
Those days we weren't considered fun
A cowboy's work is never done

He'd fight crime all the time
He'd always win:
Till his mom would break it up
And call him in
He was tough he was hard
But he was kind
But he was love: cause guys like him
Were hard to find

Ride: I like to ride again some day
I think I still know how to play
I'd play games now but it's not fun
A cowboy's work is never done"

72,Carly Simon,Anticipation,"We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway.
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day

Anticipation: anticipation
Is making me late
Is keeping me waiting

And I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.

Anticipation: Anticipation
Is making me late
Is keeping me waiting

And tomorrow we might not be together
I'm no prophet: I don't know nature's ways.
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
And stay right here: 'cause these are the good old days."

If that don't suit ya: that's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

And we got no innocence

I've been down two times
But now I'm drowning: drowning in the sea of love

Let me tell ya all about it
I've been out here so very long: I've lost all my direction
Baby when you came my way I thought I'd found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life: surely took me by surprise
And I can't seem to control these tears that's falling from my eyes

Listen to me
Baby I depended on you: for a love and affection
But now you gone and deserted me: can't you see that I'm in desperation
I'm in the middle of a bad love storm: ew yeah I just can't let it boy I
Looked around and all I could see: was water coming over me

All I do is cry: all I do is walk around and cry
But right now I'm drowning: oh I'm drowning in the sea of love

But that's all right: I don't mind drowning for your love
That's all right baby: hear me when I say it's all right
You got the kind of love that make me feel all right
You got the kind of love baby that make me cry all night long
You got the kind of love baby make me do things I don't wanna do
And it's all right"

I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
You just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

My brother sit me right down and he talked to me
He told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me
And I'm sure he meant well
Yeah: but when our talk was through
I said: brother: if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on using me
Until you use me up
Until you use me up

Sometimes: it's true
You really do abuse me 
You get me in a crowd of high-class people
And then you act real rude to me
But: oh baby: baby: baby: baby:
When you love me: I can't get enough
I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used

Of zombie: voodoo: gris gris

A terrible blow: but that's how it go
Freddie's on the corner now: if you wanna be a junkie: wow

85,Harry Chapin,Taxi,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

""Oh where you going to: my lady blue?
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain""
She just looked out the window
She said: ""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said: ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while: but she looked in the mirror
Then she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile: just the same

And she said: ""How are you Harry?""
I said: ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles and the too little smiles
I still remember you""

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of a Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far

You see: she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off to find the sky

Oh: I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man: wizard
He's hiding in me: illuminating my mind

Oh: I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'til my time runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying: afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
'Cause she's dying: aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns

And she said: ""we must get together""
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she hand me twenty dollars for a two fifty fare
She said: ""Harry: keep the change""

Well another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long: long time ago

You see she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off for the sky

And here: she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me: I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips and getting stoned

I go flying so high: when I'm stoned"

To meet in September

88,Todd Rundgren,I Saw The Light,"It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you: only you

So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me: oh so strong
About you

Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes: in your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
Till that little bell began to ring
In my head: in my head

But I tried to run
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said

'Cause my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
Till I saw the light
In your eyes: in your eyes

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different: girl: from all the rest
In my eyes

And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes"

And spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky: and they stand there
One mile over: we'll be there: and we'll see you
Ten true summers: we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love: you'll see I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky: and they stand there
One mile over: we'll be there: and we'll see you
Ten true summers: we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love: you'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud: the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind: the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create: as weather spins out of hand

Go closer: hold the land: feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears: we stand surrounded by million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out and out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out and out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky: they stand there
Twenty four before my love: and I'll be there

I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will

That it's later than it seems

Just say if it's too late for me

94,Don Mclean,Vincent / Castles In The Air,"Starry: starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen: they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry: starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen: they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry: starry night
You took your life: as lovers often do
But I could've told you: Vincent
This world was never meant for
One as beautiful as you

Starry: starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen: they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"

Bang: bang: bang
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Ting a ling a ling
I hook it on up
Get on down
Now do your stuff
Come on
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Runnin' after that hen
Come on
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Sister Rosaline
Ting a ling a ling
Look at that child
Popping that thang
Hitch up to my wagon
And get ready to roll
But don't get on board
If you can't carry the load
If balloon goes down
I fill it up with wind
If the record stops
Start it over again
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Ting a ling a ling
Hook it on up
Get on down
And do your own stuff
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
Pop that thang
Bang: bang: bang
If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Running after that hen
Come on and pop it
Pop it: pop it: pop it
Come on and pop it
Pop it: pop it: pop it
Come on and pop it"
