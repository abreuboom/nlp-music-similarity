2,Everly Brothers,All I Have To Do Is Dream / Claudette,"Dream: dream: dream: dream
Dream: dream: dream: dream

When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream: dream: dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

I can make you mine 
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime: night or day
Only trouble is: gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so: that I could die
I love you so: and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream: dream: dream: dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime: night or day
Only trouble is: gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away

I need you so: that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you 
All I have to do is dream

Dream: dream: dream
Dream: dream: dream: dream"
3,Elvis Presley,Don't / I Beg Of You,"Don't (don't): don't (don't): that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you
Baby: don't say ""don't""

Don't (don't): don't (don't) leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby: don't say ""don't""

If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying

Don't (don't): don't (don't): don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay
This you can believe: I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't
Baby: don't say ""don't"""

5,Perez Prado,Patricia,"Kiss her and your lips will always want Patricia
Stroll her: see Patricia move with all her charms
Mambo: Cha-cha: or Meringue it's Patricia
Heaven: that's where you'll be when she's in you're arms
(Instrumental Interlude)
??? In Japan they brag about the Geisha
Who cares: long Uncle Sam has got Patricia
Eyes that have a starry sort of gleam for you
She is like a million dollar dream come true
Everybody wishes they'd could steal her heart away: I guess
There's so many trying but she never: never will say yes
Eyes that have a starry sort of gleam for you
She is like a million dollar dream come true
Kiss her and your lips will always want Patricia
Stroll her: see Patricia move with all her charms
In Japan they brag about the Geisha
Who cares: long Uncle Sam has got Patricia"
6,Billy Vaughn,Sail Along Silvery Moon / Raunchy,
7,Perry Como,Catch A Falling Star / Magic Moments,"Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For love may come and tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
Just in case you feel you wanna hold her
You'll have a pocket full of starlight

Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For love may come and tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
And just in case you feel you wanna hold her
You'll have a pocket full of starlight (pocket full of starlight)

Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For when your troubles start multiplyin'
They just might
It's easy to forget them without tryin'
With just a pocket full of starlight

Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

(Save it for a rainy day)
Save it for a rainy day"
8,Champs,Tequila,
9,Tommy Edwards,It's All In The Game,"Many a tear have to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things
Your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he will call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly
Away

(Soon he'll be there at your side)
With a sweet bouquet
Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly
Away"
10,Dean Martin,Return To Me,"Return to me
Oh my dear I am so lonely
Hurry back: hurry back: oh my love
Hurry back: I'm yours

Return to me
For my heart wants you only
Hurry home: hurry home: won't you please
Hurry home to my heart?

My darling
If I've hurt you I'm sorry
Forgive me
And please say you are mine

Return to me
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back: hurry home to my arms
To my lips and my heart

Ritorna me
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu: solo tu: solo tu
Solo tu: mi amor"
11,Conway Twitty,It's Only Make Believe,"People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself: I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes: my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes: my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart: a wedding ring
My all: my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes: my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayers: my hopes: my schemes 
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe (make believe)"
12,Sheb Wooley,The Purple People Eater,"Well I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had the one long horn: one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said ""ooh-eee""
It looks like a purple people eater to me

It was a one-eyed: one-horned: flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed: one-horned: flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed: one-horned: flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)

Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said: ""Mr. Purple People Eater: don't eat me.""
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
I wouldn't eat you cuz you're so tough

It was a one-eyed: one-horned: flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed: one-horned flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed: one-horned: flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One horn?)

I said Mr. Purple People Eater: what's your line
He said it's eatin' purple people and it sure is fine
But that's not the reason that I came to land
""I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band.""

Well bless my soul: rock and roll: flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed: undergrowed: flyin' purple people eater
(We wear short shorts) Flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
And he started to rock: really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
""Sing a boop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom""

Well bless my soul: rock and roll: flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed: undergrowed: flyin' purple people eater
I like short shorts: flyin' little people eater
What a sight to see (Purple People?)

And then he went on his way: and then what do ya know
I saw him last night on a TV show
He was blowing it out: a'really knockin' em dead
Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head

13,Everly Brothers,Bird Dog / Devoted To You,"Johnny is a joker (he's a bird)
A very funny joker (he's a bird)
But when he jokes my honey (he's a dog)
His jokin' ain't so funny (what a dog)
Johnny is a joker that's a-tryin' to steal my baby (he's a bird dog)

Johnny sings a love song (like a bird)
He sings the sweetest love song (ya ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal (what a howl)
To me he's just a wolf dog (on the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy-love my baby (he's a bird dog)

Hey: bird dog get away from my quail
Hey: bird dog you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey-dove alone
Hey: bird dog: get away from my chick
Hey: bird dog: you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own

Johnny kissed the teacher (he's a bird)
He tiptoed up to reach her (he's a bird)
Well he's the teachers pet now (he's a dog)
What he wants he can get now (what a dog)
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby (he's a bird dog)

Hey: bird dog get away from my quail
Hey: bird dog you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey-dove alone
Hey: bird dog get away from my chick
Hey: bird dog you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own
He's bird..."

Guess my baby's got another date
Stood up: broken-hearted: again

I'll bet she's out havin' a ball
Not even thinkin' of me at all
Stood up: broken-hearted: again

Well: I know just what I oughta do
I oughta find somebody new
But: baby: I couldn't forget about you
Stood up: broken-hearted: again

Why must I always be the one
Left behind never havin' any fun?

But I guess I'll go on bein' a fool
Sittin' around just waitin' for you

17,Laurie London,He's Got The Whole World In His Hands,
18,Platters,Twilight Time,"Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time

When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of the day
I hear you my dear at twilight time

Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun

I count the moments darling
Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold

Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold

Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time"
19,Jimmie Rodgers,Secretly,"Why must I meet you in a secret rendezvous
Why must we steal away to steal a kiss or two
Why must we wait to do the things we want to do

Why: oh why: oh why: oh why: oh why

Wish we didn't have to meet: secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss: secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid to show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet: openly
Till we have the right to kiss: openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love: secretly

Why: oh why: oh why: oh why: oh why

Wish we didn't have to meet: secretly

Or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor
You ain't gonna rock and roll no more

Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night
Yakety yak (don't talk back)

You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety yak (don't talk back)

Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's hip: he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside

22,Elvis Presley,Wear My Ring Around Your Neck / Doncha' Think It's Time,"Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours: by heck
Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck

Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours: by heck
Let them know I love you so
And let them know by the ring around your neck

They say that goin' steady is not the proper thing
They say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
I only know that I love you and that you love me too
So: darling: please do what I ask of you

Won't you wear my ring around your neck
To tell the world I'm yours: by heck
Let them see your love for me
And let them see by the ring around your neck

Let them know I love you so
And let them know by the ring around your neck"
23,Ricky Nelson,Poor Little Fool,"I used to play around with hearts 
That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl 
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool: oh yeah
I was a fool: uh huh
(Oh oh: poor little fool)
(I was a fool: oh yeah)

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me 
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool: oh yeah
I was a fool: uh huh
(Oh oh: poor little fool)
(I was a fool: oh yeah)

She told me how she cared for me
And that we'd never part
And so for the very first time 
I gave away my heart

Poor little fool: oh yeah
I was a fool: uh huh
(Oh oh: poor little fool)
(I was a fool: oh yeah)

The next day she was gone
And I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart 
And won her victory

Poor little fool: oh yeah
I was a fool: uh huh
(Oh oh: poor little fool)
(I was a fool: oh yeah)

Well: I'd played this game with other hearts
But I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play
Love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool: oh yeah
I was a fool: uh huh

Poor little fool: oh yeah
I was a fool: uh huh

How can I live in misery (misery?)

Hang down your head: Tom Dooley

There I took her life
Met her on the mountain
Stabbed her with my knife

About a half a million
Framed autographs
Her wallet filled with pictures
She gets 'em one by one
Become so excited
Watch her: look at her run: boy

Please may I go
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy: daddy
I beg of you
Whisper to mommy
It's all right with you""

She's got the grown up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sportin' high heel shoes
Oh: but tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her trend
And be sweet sixteen
And back in class again

Pittsburgh: P. A.
Deep in the heart of Texas
And round the Frisco Bay
Way out in St. Louis
Way down to New Orleans

Looking ba-a-ack over my life
I can see where I caused you strife
But I know: oh yes I know
I'd never make that same mistake again

Looking ba-a-ack over my deeds
I can see signs a wise man heeds
And if I just ha-ad the chance
I'd never make that same mistake again

Once my cup was overflowing
But I gave nothing in retu-u-urn
Now I can't begin to te-ell you
What a lesson I have learned

Looking ba-a-ack over the slate
I can see love turned to hate
But I know: oh yes I know
I'd never make that same mistake again"

So if she's the one: don't let her run away

To cry their troubles away
And they call it Lonesome Town

To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
Going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget"

Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if its real

When somebody needs you
Its no good unless she needs you

Through the good or lean years
And for all those in between years
Come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you

Now they all dig that crazy beat
Way Out Willie gave 'em all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet

Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior and that ain't all
Well: the baby got famous and it's plain to see
Doin' that hand jive on TV"
70,Four Preps,Big Man,"I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now
Well I talked big yesterday: but boy you oughta see me now
I bragged too long that your love was strong
There'd never be another guy
But you said more when you whispered your goodbye
I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now

I said that I was through with you
I didn't need you anyhow
I said I didn't need you then
But boy you oughta see me now

Those bragging words that you were mine
Of that there was no doubt
So empty now that half my life's walked out
Half my life left me yesterday
And boy you oughta see me now

If you will just forgive me dear
I'll never break another vow
I broke so many yesterday
And boy you oughta see me now

I couldn't see it yesterday
But now I know it's true
The only thing that made me big was you

I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now
If you could only see me now
You should see me now"

What am longing for: each lonely night?
To feel your lips to mine and hold you tight.
You'll be my little girl my whole life through.
Baby: nobody else: nobody else will do.

I want you close to me: that's all I know.
I want you all the time: cause darling I love you so.

73,Chuck Berry,Johnny B Goode,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh: the engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by: they would stop and say
""Oh my: but that little country boy could play""

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

His mother told him: ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'""

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go go go Johnny go!
Go go go Johnny go!
Go go go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!"
74,Eddie Cochran,Summertime Blues,"I'm a-gonna raise a fuss
I'm a-gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer
Just-a trying to earn a dollar

Every time I call my baby
Try to get a date
My boss says ""No dice: son
You gotta work late""

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm-a gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

Well my mama and papa told me
""Son: you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car
To go a-ridin' next Sunday""

Well: I didn't go to work
Told the boss I was sick
""You can't use the car
'Cause you didn't work a lick""

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm-a gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem
To the United Nations

Well: I called my congressman
And he said: quote:
""I'd like to help you: son
But you're too young to vote""

Sometimes I wonder
What I'm-a gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertime blues"
75,Roger Williams,Near You,
76,Peggy Lee,Fever,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever! in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever! in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet: she felt the same
When he put his arms around her 
He said: ""Julie: baby: you're my flame

""Thou giveth fever
""When we kisseth
""Fever with thy flaming youth
""Fever! I'm afire
""Fever: yea: I burn: forsooth.""

Cap'n Smith and Pocahontas 
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said: ""Daddy: oh: don't you dare!

""He gives me fever
""With his kisses
""Fever when he holds me tight
""Fever! I'm his missus
""Daddy: won't you treat him right?""

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever
When you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever! till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn"
77,Ed Townsend,For Your Love,"For your love: oh: I would do anything

For your kiss

Oh: I would go anywhere

Anywhere: for your kiss

More foolish I grow
With each heart beat
But we all get foolish
That's why I repeat

For your love
(Ah: ah: ah: ah)
Oh: I would do anything
(Ah: ah: ah: ah)
I would do anything: for your kiss

You are what you are to me
You are my happiness
That's what you are

You have my sweet caress
You share my loneliness
You are my dream come true
That's what you are

Heaven and heaven alone
Can take your love from me
'Cause I'd be a fool
To ever leave you dear
And a fool I'd never be

You are my destiny
You share my reverie
You're more than life to me
That's what you are

You are my destiny
You share my reverie
You are my happiness
That's what you are"

Who don't understand the Eyetalian language:

Lazy Mary you better get up
She answered back I am not able
Lazy Mary you better get up
We need the sheets for the table

Lazy Mary you smoke in bed
There's only one man you should marry
My advice to you would be
Is to pay attention to me

You'd better marry a fireman
He'll come and go: go and come

81,Johnny Cash,Ballad of a Teenage Queen,"(Dream on: dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)

There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on: dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was queen of the senior prom
She could cook just like her mum
She had everything it seems
Pure delightest teenage queen (pure delightest teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on: dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money: bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on: dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on: dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train)
Next day she was at the door
Of the lonely boy next door who worked at the candy store

(Now this story has some more: you'll hear it all at the candy store)"
82,Pat Boone,It's Too Soon to Know,"Does she love me? It's too soon to know
Can I believe her when she tells me so?
Is she foolin'? Is it all a game?
Am I the fire or just another flame?
A one-sided love would break my heart
She may be just acting and playing a part

If she don't love me let her tell me so
I won't hold her if she wants to go
Though I'll cry when she's gone
I won't die: I'll live on
If it's so: it's too soon: way too soon to know

If she don't love me let her tell me so
I can't hold her if she wants to go
Though I'll cry when she's gone
I won't die: I'll live on
If it's so: it's too soon: way too soon to know"

84,Perry Como,Kewpie Doll,"Well I took my baby to the carnival
An' I heard that barker yell (Hey! Hey!)
""Come on an' win yourself a purdy Kewpie Doll:
All you gotta do is ring the bell!""
Well I swung the hammer just as hard as I could:
An' you should have heard the wild applause ... (Hooray!)
When ""bong"" went the bell
And the man said:
""Well: I guess the Kewpie Doll is yours!""(Yeah Yeah!)

I said: ""Gimmie a doggie or a teddy bear
Or a high school banner for my wall:
'Cause I got me a real live Kewpie Doll
An' she's the cutest one of them all!""

(Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!
Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!)

Ah then: we walked down the midway
Till we saw a crowd an' the man said ""Try your skill:
Five shots for a quarter: make a duck hit the water
An' give your little baby a thrill""
Well: my baby smiled an' she kissed me once
An' I felt I was nine feet tall
Oh! five shots crashed and the five ducks splashed
An' the man gave me a Kewpie Doll!

I said: ""Gimmie a doggie or a teddy bear
Or a high school banner for my wall:
'Cause I got me a real live Kewpie Doll
An' she's the cutest one of them all!""

(Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!
Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!)

Ah then: my baby said: ""Honey: let m try my luck
An' knock the milk bottles off the shelf!""
You should have seen this chick: she was a dead-eye Dick
Hey! I couldn't do it better myself!
An' then my face got red and my chest swelled up
An' my eyes bugged outta my head
'Cause when the prize turned out to be a Kewpie Doll
This is what my baby said: SHE SAID ...

""Gimmie a doggie or a teddy bear
Or a high school banner for my wall:
'Cause I got me a real live Kewpie Doll
An' he's the cutest one of them all!""

I said: ""She's the cutest one of them all!""
An' she's the cutest one of them all! (Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!)
