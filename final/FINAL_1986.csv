1,Dionne and Friends,That's What Friends Are For,
2,Lionel Richie,"Say You, Say Me","Say you: say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you: say me
Say it together
Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you: say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you: say me
Say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand: someone who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you""

Say you: say me
Say it for always: oh
That's the way it should be

Say you: say me
Say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers: oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right: I'm telling you
It's time to start believing: oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star

Say you: say me
Say it for always: aw
That's the way it should be

Say you: say me
Say it together
Naturally

Say it together
Naturally"
3,Klymaxx,I Miss You,"Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you
Then I realized
That it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me...

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe (just can't believe)
That we're through...

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I: And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
All the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I: and I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see

I've got to gather my senses together (Together)
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now (over now)
Be strong (be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.

I miss you (I miss you...)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and dream."
4,Patti Labelle and Michael McDonald,On My Own,"So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you

On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed in love (in love)
Now here I stand
I wonder why: ooh

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
(On my own) This wasn't how it was supposed to end
(On my own) I wish that we could do it all again

So many times I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

On my own (This wasn't how it was supposed to end)
On my own (I wish that we could do it all again)
On my own (I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone)
By myself

So many times
I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life

I don't want to live without you
On my own
On my own
On my own

This wasn't how it was supposed to end
I wish that we could do it all again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
On my own: I've got to find where I belong again

I've got to learn how to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself by myself

I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's my time again
And I have faith that I will shine again

I have faith in me
On my own
On my own
On my own"
5,Mr. Mister,Broken Wings,"Baby: don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each others' hands
This time might be the last: I fear
Unless I make it all too clear
I need you so: ohh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby: I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right: mmm
Baby: it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
I need you so

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly
Learn to live and love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in: yeah: yeah

Let us in
Let us in

Baby: it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
Yeah yeah yeah: yeah yeah

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again

The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly
Learn to live and love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up for us and let us in: yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ooh"
6,Whitney Houston,How Will I Know,"There's a boy I know: he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes: takes me to the clouds above: mm
Ooh: I lose control: can't seem to get enough: uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming: tell me is it really love?

Hoo: how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you: 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone: but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong: why do I feel weak?

Oh: wake me! I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now: uhh
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

Ooh: tell me: how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you: 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone: but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong: why do I feel weak?

If he loves me: if he loves me not: mm
If he loves me: ooh: if he loves me not
Hey: if he loves me: if he loves me not

Oh: how will I know?
Ooh: how will I know?
How will I know?
Hey: how will I know?
Hey: hey: hey: hey

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you: 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone: but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong: why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know?

Hoo: how will I know? (I fall in love)
How will I know?
Hey: how will I know? (I'm asking you)
How will I: how will I..."
7,Eddie Murphy,Party All The Time,"Girl I can't understand it: why you want to hurt me
After all of the things I've done for you
I buy you champagne: roses and put diamonds on your fingers
But still you hang out all night: what am I to do

My girl wants to party all the time:
Party all the time: party all the time

8,Survivor,Burning Heart,"Two worlds collide: rival nations
It's a primitive clash: venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes

Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West: or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

In the burning heart: just about to burst
There's a quest for answers: an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night: rising like a spire
In the burning heart: the unmistakable fire

In the warrior's code: there's no surrender
Though his body says stop: his spirit cries never
Deep in our soul a quiet ember
Knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on

It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack: it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

In the burning heart: just about to burst
There's a quest for answers: an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night: rising like a spire
In the burning heart: the unmistakable fire"

K&#xFD;rie

The wind blows hard against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old: it holds my memories
My body burns a gem like flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

10,Robert Palmer,Addicted To Love,"The lights are on: but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats: your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes

You can't sleep no: you can't eat
There's no doubt: you're in deep
Your throat is tight: you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Oh: you like to think that you're immune to the stuff: oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

You see the signs: but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine

A one track mind: you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do

Oh: you like to think that you're immune to the stuff: oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it

11,Whitney Houston,Greatest Love Of All,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"
12,Atlantic Starr,Secret Lovers,"Here we are the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out
It could mess up: both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
They can never no: oh no: we can't leave a trace

Secret lovers that's what we are: we shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go: oh no: 'cause we love each other so

Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously: alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall

Secret lovers that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go: 'cause what we feel is oh so real
So real

You and me: are we fair
Is this cruel: or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin' love we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it: we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful: so that no one will know

Secret lovers: that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is oh so real
So real"
13,Carl Anderson and Gloria Loring,Friends And Lovers,"What would you say if I told you
I've always wanted to hold you
I don't know what we're afraid of
Nothing would change if we made love

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Oh no: we could be both to each other

And yes: it's a chance that we're taking
Somebody's heart may be breaking
But we can't stop what's inside us
Our love for each other will guide us

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other

I've been through you and you've been through me
And sometimes a friend is the hardest to see
But we always know when it's laid on the line
Nobody else is as easy to find

So I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I'll be your friend and I'll be your lover
'Cause I know in our hearts we agree
We don't have to be one or the other
Oh no: we could be both to each other"
14,Peter Cetera,Glory Of Love,"Tonight it's very clear
'Cause we're both lying here
There's so many things I wanna say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever 
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of
We'll live forever 
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love 

It's like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you&#x2019;re dreaming of
We're gonna live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love"
15,Pet Shop Boys,West End Girls,"Forever

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad: too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables

In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police: there's a madman around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town

In a West End town: a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town: a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

Too many shadows: whispering voices
Faces on posters: too many choices
If: when: why: what
How much have you got?

Have you got it: do you get it
If so: how often?
And which do you choose
A hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

In a West End town: a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town: a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls

In a West End town: a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh: West End town: a dead-end world
East End boys: West End girls
West End girls

You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
We've got no future: we've got no past
Here today: built to last

In every city: in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)

In a West End town: a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town: a dead-end world

16,Billy Ocean,There'll Be Sad Songs,"Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory?
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song 
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Oh: mmm: oh
You're my desire: you take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you: oh

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Some things you can never: never choose

One chance: one love
Your chance to let me know

Even if you try: yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance: one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on just running away
If we stay any longer 
We will surely never get away

20,Steve Winwood,Higher Love,"Think about it: there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it: life is wasted time
Look inside your heart: I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world: what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love: oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning: and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world: what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love: oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love: oh
Bring me a higher love
A good kind of love: want a higher love

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then: I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

Bring it: oh

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Whoa: bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love: oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love: oh (bring me)

Holding back the tears

To fill this space of emptiness

Of flesh and blood I'm made

Born to make mistakes

So many nights I longed to hold you
So many times I looked and saw your face
Nothing could change the way I feel
No one else could ever take your place

27,Berlin,Take My Breath Away,"Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching: I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

Take my breath away
My love
Take my breath away
Oh yeah
Take my breath away (yeah)
My love
Take my breath away"

33,Heart,These Dreams,"Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead: moving in the trees
White skin in linen: perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand (shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly: come closer than this
(all I remember) But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night
I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake: the further I'm away (further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger?
Could it be spring or fall?
I walked without a cut
Through a stain-glass wall
(Weaker in my eyesight) Weaker in my eyesight
A Candle in my grip (words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night
I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake: the further I'm away (further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away
From the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes: freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night
I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake: the further I'm away
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night
I live another life

These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake..."

Broken hearts and broken dreams
Then I wake up and you're not there

35,Madonna,Live To Tell,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then: it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once: I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you - can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then: it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I'd run away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold: the secret that I hide? 
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then: it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then: it will burn inside of me"

37,Level 42,Something About You,"Ooh...
Ooh...
How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone: fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight

Ooh...
Ooh...
And there's something about you
I couldn't live without you
Tonight"

Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party
It's starting tonight

Oh: what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh: what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

When the music is right
If you see somebody hangin' around
Don't get uptight
The only thing we want to do tonight
Is go 'round and 'round
And turn upside down
Come on! Let's get down!

So come on! Let's get loose
Don't hold back

Don't be discouraged
Oh: I realize
It's hard to take courage

You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors: true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy: can't remember when
I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
And don't be afraid to let them show

Can't remember when I last saw you laughing

Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Begging you to touch and go

Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Heading into twilight
Spreading out her wings tonight
She got you jumping off the deck
And shoving into overdrive

Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you right into the danger zone

They'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Oh: yeah!

Out along the edges
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone

Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone"

He stood me up again.
Again?
Mmm hmm.
Well: what's up with this guy? Do you really like him that much?
Yes: honey: I love him. He is fine: he does a lot of nice things for me.
I know he used to do nice stuff for you: but what has he done for you lately?

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind...
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

Used to go to dinner almost every night
Danced until I thought I'd lose my breath
Now it seems your dancin' feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death...
Ain't that a shame?

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm tellin' you... no way.

You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always puttin' off what we could do today
Soap opera says you've got one life to live
Who's right who's wrong?

What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

This is wild... I swear."
44,Howard Jones,No One Is To Blame,"You can look at the menu but you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions but you can't have a seat

You can feel the punishment but you can't commit the sin

And you want her: and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her: and she wants you
No one: no one: no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion but you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules and live to count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her: and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her: and she wants you
No one: no one: no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit but you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain

And you want her: and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her: and she wants you
No one: no one: no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame"

47,Miami Sound Machine,Words Get In The Way,"I realize you're seeing someone new
I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side:
The one you always try to hide from me.

But I know when you have something on your mind.
You've been trying to tell me for the longest time.
And before you break my heart in two:
There's something I've been trying to say to you.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes:
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry:
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say ""I love you""
But the words got in the way

Your heart has always been an open door
But baby I don't even know you anymore.
And despite the fact it's hurting me:
I know the time has come to set you free.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes:
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry:
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say ""I love you""
But the words got in the way

I'm trying to say ""I love you""

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream

But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday (oh: oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh: oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday (oh: oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh: oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday

Of all of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night: last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey: let's go make some noise.""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday (oh: oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh: oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)

Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying: crying: crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Ah: I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you: you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh you: all over you: ooh

Never wanted to see things you way
I had to go astray
Oh: why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener (why oh why)
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong? (Leavin' me all alone)

Don't you know the heart will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames: why should I take the blame
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted: add me to the broken hearts you collected

Ah: I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I: I don't what to do
I'm all cried out (I'm all) over you (I'm cried out too)
(Whoa: whoa...)

Ah: I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you

Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover

I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I took a day job amendment: I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You wanna message a confession: you wanna martyr me too
You wanna margin of error for two

Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer: an exception: I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew

In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
Wanna forget how to remember with you

No: I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah: I can be myself here in this small town

74,Mike and The Mechanics,All I Need Is A Miracle,"I said ""Go if you wanna go
Stay if you wanna stay""
I didn't care if you hung around me
I didn't care if you went away
And I know you were never right
I'll admit I was never wrong
I could never make up my mind
I made it up as I went along

And though I treated you like a child
I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

All I need is a miracle: all I need is you
All I need is a miracle: all I need is you
All I need is a miracle: all I need is you

I never had any time
And I never had any call
But I went out of my way just to hurt you
The one I shouldn't hurt at all
I thought I was being cool
Yeah: I thought I was being strong
But it's always the same old story
You never know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle: all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle: all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle: all I need is you

And if I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle: all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle: all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle: all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a: all I need is a
All I need is you (All I need is a miracle)"
75,Michael McDonald,Sweet Freedom,"No more runnin' down the wrong road
Dancin' to a diff'rent drum
Can't you see what's goin' on
Deep inside your heart

Always searchin' for the real thing
Livin' like it's far away
Just leave all the madness in yesterday
You're holdin' the key
When you believe it

Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive on and on

We'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Smilin' with the risin' sun
Livin' like we've never done
Goin' all the way

Reachin' out to meet the changes
Touchin' every shining star
The light of tomorrow is right where we are
There's no turnin' back
From what I'm feeling

Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive on and on

'Cause there'll be starlight all night
When we're close together
Share those feelings dancin' in your eyes tonight
They're guiding us
Shinin' till the mornin' light

Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along

Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma

They sat on the stoney ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down to listen
He said in winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy
And The Beatles

Yeah: yeah

Hey ma ma ma ma

The evening turned to rain
Watched the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down to the station
And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight...bye-bye

That I don't wanna go

We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start

Everytime that I look at you
I can see the future
'Cause you know I know: baby
That I don't wanna go

To make you change your mind?

I watch the world go 'round and 'round
And see mine turnin' upside down

Throwing it all away

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
'Cause you know I know: baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey

I pull my shirt off and pray
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

Stretching my love down the way
To your invitation stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
'Cause maybe we have more play time than money

Maximum big surprise
She knows something new

I pull my shirt off and pray
I'm saving myself to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

By roads and backways a lover's chance down wind
Cut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further: entangled strands all sing
I'm saving some time to slip away
We could dance!

Shouldn't be asking: wild and scheming
Could be my election day

In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe

Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Oh: Nikita you will never know: anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh: Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no: Nikita you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night?

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh: Nikita you will never know: anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Oh no: Nikita you'll never know

Oh: Nikita you will never know: never know anything about my home

Was your sister and your cousin

With the boys in school
And her feet was flyin' up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way

Then my next door neighbor
Had a daughter: had a favour

91,Moody Blues,Your Wildest Dreams,"Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies 
Reflected in your eyes
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

Once the world was new
Our bodies felt the morning dew
That greets the brand-new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away
I wonder if you care
I wonder if you still remember
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours
Love was all we knew
And all I knew was you
I wonder if you know
I wonder if you think about it
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays

And when the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies 
Mirrored in your eyes
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams"
92,Paul McCartney,Spies Like Us,"Ooh ooh what do you do 
No one else can dance like you 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 
Hey hey what do you say 
Someone took your plans away 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 

Hey don't feel afraid 
Of an undercover aid 
There's no need to fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 

Spies like us 

We don't know the meaning of fear 
We play every minute by ear 
One for all and all for one 
Everybody's on the run 
Especially at this time of year 

Ooh ooh what do you do 
No one else can dance like you 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody got spies like us 

Hey hey what do you say 
No one else can look that way 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody got spies like us 

We get there by hook or by crook 
We don't do a thing by the book 
Never needed special clothes 
How we did it no one knows 
I guess we must have had what it took 

Ooh ooh: ooh 
Oh when things get tough 
(Oh when things get tough) 
Guys like us act rough 
(Guys like us act rough) 

Hey hey what do you say 
Someone took your plans away 
So what's all the fuss 
There ain't nobody that spies like us 

Spies like us"
93,Starpoint,Object Of My Desire,"Ooh...
Whoa: whoa: whoa... yeah

You glanced my way: I lost all control
Anxiety had taken hold
My body quivered: hot flashes ignited in me: ooh: ooh: ooh...
Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words: I was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy: ooh: ooh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams
""Please make love to me""

You're the object of my desire
Baby: ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey: you really turn me on

You're the object (Sugar) of my desire (Yeah)
Oh: baby: ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey: you really turn me on

When I go to sleep at night
Visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me: ay-yi-yi-yi
I pinch myself as you're lyin' there
We kiss each other: now I'm really scared
Too much to ask even for a fantasy: oh: oh: oh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams
""Please make love to me""

'Cause you're the object of my desire (Yeah: yeah)
Baby: ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey: you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey: you really turn me on and on and on and on

You're the object (I've got to have your love)
(I need your love)
Object (Wanna be the one: baby)
Hey: you really turn me on

You're the object (Love so fine)
Baby (I wanna know): would you be mine
Object
Hey: you really turn me on and on and on and on

Object
Object
Hey: you really turn me on"
94,Daryl Hall,Dreamtime,"I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl: I know what to believe 

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away: don't care where you go
You want to run away: run away: that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up: ooh
You're living on dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up 

In your dream: it's overcast
Rain comes down: moving your way fast
You want to run away: don't care where you go
You want to run away: run away: that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through: throw yourself on the floor
Oh: when you're looking up: it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up: ooh
You're living on dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up: shape up
You're living on dreamtime (you want to run away)
Whoa-whoa
You're living on dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
Want to run away: want to run away

I know
I say

You're living in dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
Shape up
You're living on dreamtime: baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
You're living in dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in dreamtime: it's hard to carry on: girl"
95,Force M.D.'s,Tender Love,"Here I lay all alone
Tossin turning
Longing for some of your
Tender Love

I'm waiting for the right
Moment to come
So I can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me

Tender love (Tender love)
Love so tender (love)
Pulling me close to you
Baby I surrender

Candles they light the dark
Now I see how lovely the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me

I want you more and more
Can't resist you
Oh then I feel your touch
Tender love

And you're loving me straight from the heart
Hold me nearer
Please let me be a part
Of the tend love you're giving to me

Tender love (tender love)
Love so tender
Holding me close to you
Baby I surrender

Oh oh oh whooo yeah
Surrender baby
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Oh (tender love) oh oh oh

Please let me be a part
Of the tender love you're giving to me"
96,Thompson Twins,King For A Day,"I know you well
And I can tell
Something's on your mind

'Cause in your dreams
The demon screams
I know he's going to hurt you blind

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all 
We need to get us through

And diamond rings
And all those things
They never sparkle
Like your smile

And as for fame
It's just a name
That only satisfies
You for awhile

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through

I've heard it said
Or maybe read
Only money makes
The world go round

But all the gold
Won't heal your soul
If your world should
Tumble to the ground

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

So listen
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need: yeah

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need: yeah

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need: yeah

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is
All we need to get us through

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
Just one thing to say
Love"

98,George Michael,A Different Corner,"I'd say love was a magical flame
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there
Had I been there

I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So: I don't dare
No: I don't dare

'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared
I'm so scared

Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner
And we never would have met
Would you care?

I don't understand it for you it's a breeze
Little by little
You've brought me to my knees
Don't you care?

No: I've never come close
In all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is
Is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could: I would: I swear

Oh: I swear"
99,Toto,I'll Be Over You,"Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

(Instrumental solo)

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart...
(As soon as my heart stops breakin')
(Anticipating)"
100,Stevie Wonder,Go Home,"Her parents said: girl don't leave home
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man: steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home 

Long days: short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family: my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home  

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word: my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family: my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong: go home
Go home baby: you better go home right now
Go home: little girl you better go home"
