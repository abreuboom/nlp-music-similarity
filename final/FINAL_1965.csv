1,Sam The Sham and The Pharaohs,Wooly Bully,"Uno: dos: one: two: tres: quatro
Hey: Wooly Bully
Watch it now: watch it
Here he come: here he come
Watch it now: he'll getcha

Matty told Hatty about a thing she saw
Had two big horns and a wooly jaw

Wooly bully: wooly bully
Wooly bully: wooly bully: wooly bully

Hatty told Matty: ""Let's don't take no chance
Let's not be L-seven: come and learn to dance""

Wooly bully: wooly bully
Wooly bully: wooly bully: wooly bully
Watch it now: watch it: watch it: watch it


Matty told Hatty: ""That's the thing to do
Get you someone really to pull the wool with you""

Wooly bully: wooly bully
Wooly bully: wooly bully: wooly bully
Watch it now: watch it: here he come
You got it: you got it"
2,Four Tops,I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch),
3,Rolling Stones,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,"I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no: I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car
And a man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no: oh no: no: no
Hey: hey: hey: that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no: I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no: oh no: no: no
Hey: hey: hey: that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no: I can't get no

When I'm ridin' 'round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl
Who tells me: ""Baby better come back maybe next week
'Cause you see I'm on a losin' streak""
I can't get no: oh no: no: no
Hey: hey: hey: that's what I say

I can't get no
I can't get no
I can't get no
Satisfaction
No satisfaction
No satisfaction
No satisfaction
I can't get no"
4,We Five,You Were On My Mind,"When I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
I got troubles: whoa: oh
I got worries: whoa: oh
I got wounds to bind

So I went to the corner
Just to ease my pain
Said to: just to ease my pain
I got troubles: whoa: oh
I got worries: whoa: oh
I came home again

But I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
Yeah: I got troubles: whoa: oh
I got worries: whoa: oh
I got wounds to bind

Hey: I got a feeling
Down in my shoes
Said a-way down in my shoes
Hey: I got to ramble: whoa: oh
I got to move on: whoa: oh
I got to walk away my blues

But I woke up this morning
You were on my mind
And you were on my mind
Hey: I got troubles: whoa: oh
I got worries: whoa: oh
I got wounds to bind"
5,Righteous Brothers,You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',"You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it: (baby)
But baby: baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa: that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone...gone...gone...woah

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize the things I do
It makes me just feel like crying (baby)
'Cause baby: something beautiful's dying

You lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa: that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone...gone...gone...woah

Baby baby: I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do: yeah
We had a love: a love: a love you don't find everyday
So don't: don't: don't: don't let it slip away

Baby (baby): baby (baby)
I beg of you please...please
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love (I need your love)
Well: bring it on back (So bring it on back)
Bring it on back (so bring it on back)

Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa: that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'

6,Petula Clark,Downtown,"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries: all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help: I know: downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles: forget all your cares

So go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure: downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles: forget all your cares

So go downtown
Where all the lights are bright: downtown
Waiting for you tonight: downtown
You're gonna be alright now: downtown

Downtown
Downtown

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles: forget all our cares

So go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more: downtown
Everything is waiting for you: downtown

Downtown (downtown)
Downtown (downtown)
Downtown (downtown)
Downtown (downtown)"
7,Beatles,Help!,"Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know I need someone

When I was younger
(When I was young)
So much younger than today

And now my life has changed

8,Herman's Hermits,Can't You Hear My Heartbeat,"Every time I see you lookin' my way
Baby: baby: can't you hear my heartbeat?
In the car or walkin' down the highway
Baby: baby: can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you move up closer to me
I get a feeling that's ooh-wee

Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

When I feel you put your arms around me
Baby: baby: can't you hear my heartbeat?
Then I'm glad: I'm mighty glad I found you
Baby: baby: can't you hear my heartbeat?

When you asked me to meet your ma
I knew that baby: we'd be going far

Can't you hear the pounding of my heartbeat?
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

All my friends are cryin' out to meet you
Baby: baby: can't you hear my heartbeat?
Now's the time to go and see the preacher

9,Elvis Presley,Crying In The Chapel,"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord (one accord)
We gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

Ev'ry sinner looks for something
That will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer
He must get down on his knees

Meet your neighbor in the chapel
Join with him in tears of joy
You'll know the meaning of contentment
Then you'll be happy with the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray (knees and pray)
Your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way (and you'll surely find the way)"
10,Temptations,My Girl,"I've got sunshine

What can make me feel this way?

Talkin' 'bout my girl

12,Roger Miller,King Of The Road,"Trailer for sale or rent: rooms to let fifty cents

Ah but: two hours of pushin' broom buys a
Eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means: king of the road

Third boxcar midnight train: destination Bangor: Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes: I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found: short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means: king of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All the children and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around

And never let me go until you've told me: told me
What I want to know and then just hold me: hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

Thrill me (thrill me): thrill me (thrill me)
Walk me down the lane where shadows
Will be (will be) will be (will be)
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be: we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you

They told me ""Be sensible with your new love""
""Don't be fooled: thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you: love
When you take me in your arms
And drive me slowly out of my mind

Kiss me (kiss me): kiss me (kiss me)
And when you do: I'll know that you
Will miss me (miss me): miss me (miss me)
If we ever say ""Adieu"": so kiss me: kiss me

Shoot 'em 'fore they run now.

Hey
 
Put on your red dress

16,Sonny and Cher,I Got You Babe,"They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me: and baby I got you

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned: our money's all been spent
I guess that's so: we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad: you're a clown
And if I get scared: you're always around

Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care: with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me

I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you: I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe

I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe"
17,Gary Lewis and The Playboys,This Diamond Ring,"Who wants to buy
This diamond ring?
She took it off her finger now
It doesn't mean a thing

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
So if you've got someone whose love is true
Let it shine for you

This stone is genuine
Like love should be
And if your baby's truer than
My baby was to me

This diamond ring can be something beautiful
And this diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
And then your heart won't have to break like mine did
If there's love behind it

This diamond ring can mean something beautiful
And this diamond ring can be dreams that are coming true
And then your heart won't have to break like mine did
If there's love behind it

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before
So if you've got someone whose love is true
Let it shine for you

This diamond ring doesn't shine for me anymore
And this diamond ring doesn't mean what it did before"

19,Herman's Hermits,Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter,"Mrs. Brown: you've got a lovely daughter
Girls as sharp as her are something rare
But it's sad: she doesn't love me now
She's made it clear enough: it ain't no good to pine

She wants to return those things I bought her
Tell her she can keep them just the same
Things have changed: she doesn't love me now
She's made it clear enough: it ain't no good to pine

Walkin' about
Even in a crowd: well
You'll pick her out
Makes a bloke feel so proud

If she finds that I've been 'round to see you ('round to see you)
Tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine (feelin' fine: ooh)
Don't let on: don't say she's broke my heart
I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine

20,Supremes,Stop! In The Name Of Love,"Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby baby: I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your: your secluded nights
I've even seen her: maybe one or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard: hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid of losing you forever

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart (Baby: think it over)
Stop in the name of love (Think it over: baby)
Before you break my heart (Ooh: think it over: baby)

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart"
21,Righteous Brothers,Unchained Melody,"Oh: my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long: lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea: to the sea
To the open arms of the sea: yeah
Lonely rivers sigh: ""Wait for me: wait for me
I'll be coming home: wait for me""

22,Herman's Hermits,Silhouettes,"Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within: the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh: what a lovely couple they made

Put his arms around your waist: held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Lost control and rang your bell: I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block

Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you're my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days: two silhouettes on the shade

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah"
23,Seekers,I'll Never Find Another You,"There's a new world somewhere
They call the promised land.
And I'll be there someday
If you could hold my hand.
I still need you there beside me
No matter what I do
For I know I'll never find another you.

There is always someone
For each of us: they say.
And you'll be my someone 
Forever and a day.
I could search the whole world over
Until my life is through
But I know I'll never find another you.

It's a long: long journey 
So stay by my side.
When I walk through the storm 
You'll be my guide: be my guide.
If they gave me a fortune
My virtue would be small.
I could lose it all tomorrow
And never mind at all.
But if I should lose your love: dear:
I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you.

But if I should lose your love: dear:
I don't know what I'd do.
For I know I'll never find another you.
Another you.
Another you!"

25,Byrds,Mr. Tambourine Man,"Hey: Mr. Tambourine Man: play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey: Mr. Tambourine Man: play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning: I'll come followin' you

Take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'

I'm ready to go anywhere: I'm ready for to fade
Unto my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey: Mr. Tambourine Man: play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey: Mr. Tambourine Man: play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you"
26,Sounds Orchestral,Cast Your Fate To The Wind,"A month of nights: a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
You set your sail when the tide comes in
And you cast your fate to the wind

You shift your course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is your best friend
And you just cast your fate to the wind

That time has such a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone: alone

There never was: there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away

So now you're old: you're wise: you're smart
You're just a man with half a heart
You wonder how it might have been
Had you not cast your fate to the wind"
27,Barbara Mason,"Yes, I'm Ready","I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to

Yes: I'm ready (ready) to learn (to learn)
To fall in love: to fall in love: to fall in love with you

I don't even know how to hold your hand

All the things you want me to

Violence flarin': bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'
You don't believe in war but whats that gun you're totin'?
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

But you tell me
Over and over and over again my friend
Ah: you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
Can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed: there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around you boy: it's bound to scare you boy

And you tell me
Over and over and over again my friend
Ah: you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

Yeah my blood's so mad feels like coagulating
I'm sitting here just contemplatin'
I can't twist the truth it knows no regulation
Handful of senators don't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'

And you tell me
Over and over and over again my friend
Ah: you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

Think of all the hate there is in Red China
Then take a look around to Selma: Alabama
You may leave here for four days in space
But when you return it's the same old place
The pounding of the drums: the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace
Hate your next door neighbor but don't forget to say grace

And tell me
Over and over and over and over again my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
Mmm: no: no: you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction"

I say now let's play a game
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name
The first letter of the name: I treat it like it wasn't there
But a B or an F or an M will appear
And then I say bo add a B then I say the name and Bonana fanna and a
Fo

And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme

Arnold!
Arnold: Arnold bo Barnold Bonana fanna fo Farnold
Fee fy mo Marnold Arnold!

But if the first two letters are ever the same:
I drop them both and say the name like
Bob: Bob drop the B's Bo ob
For Fred: Fred drop the F's Fo red
For Mary: Mary drop the M's Mo ary
That's the only rule that is contrary.

Okay? Now say Bo: Bo
Now Tony with a B: Bony
Then Bonana fanna fo: bonana fanna fo
Then you say the name again with an F very plain: Fony
Then a fee fy and a mo: fee fy mo
Then you say the name again with an M this time: Mony

But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights

Ooh!
But now he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied

It's easy for friends to say let him go
But I'm the one who needs him so
It's his love that makes me strong
Without him I can't go on

This time I'll live my life at ease
Being happy lovin' whom I please
And each time we make romance
I'll be thankful for a second chance

Ooh!
'Cause he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
Ooh!

How can Mary tell me what to do
When she lost her love so true?
And Flo: she don't know
'Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo

I listened once to my friends' advice

You dreamed that he said goodbye

He held two roses within his hand
Two roses he gave to you
The red rose tells you of his passion
The white rose his love so true

41,Bob Dylan,Like A Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call: say: ""Beware: doll: you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you

You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh: you've gone to the finest school: alright: miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it

You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp: but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: ""Do you want to
Make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh: you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it: baby

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now: he calls you: you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing: you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now: you got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"

58,Marvin Gaye,I'll Be Doggone,"Well: I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day (baby)
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay (baby)
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey: Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone: hmmm

Now hey: hey: hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey: hey: I'd be long gone
Oh: I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone: hmmm

Now did you hear
Well now: what I say?
Oh: believe me

Well: every woman should try
To be whatever has man wants her to be
And I don't want much
All I want from you is for you to be true to me

Well: I'd be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend (baby)
Oh: baby: And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey: hey: hey: I'd be long gone
Well I wouldn't be doggone baby
I'd be long gone"
59,Gary Lewis and The Playboys,Save Your Heart For Me,"Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself with fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you
And save your heart for me

When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under the starlit skies
Please don't let the star get in your eyes
Juest save your heart for me

When you're all alone: far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new

When the autumn winds began to blow
Ane the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know
So save your heart for me
Darlin': save your heart for me

Please remember I'm in love with you
So save your heart for me
Darlin': save your heart for me"

Count me in through thick and thin

You'll find it happens all the time
Love will never do what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm: and she made a magic sign
She said: ""What you need is Love Potion No. 9""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said: I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine: it looked like Indian ink
I held my nose: I closed my eyes: I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed that cop down at 34th and Vine

Goodbye baby. We'll meet again soon maybe...
But until we do: all my best to you

I go to places we used to go
But I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside

We both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces you can't find

Oh: it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone

Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone
Left this emptiness 
I only reminisce the happiness we spent 
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

85,Joe Tex,Hold What You've Got,"That a man can have a good woman
That he can call his very own
A woman who will stay right there at home
And mind the children while he's gone to work
A woman who will have his dinner cooked
When he comes home
Where some men make mistakes is
When they go out and stay because they feel
No other wants his woman but him
Well listen: if you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some men will have her before you can count 1: 2: 3
Yes he will: yes he will

Listen girls: this goes for you too
Because you know I've seen so man women
Who've had so many good men in life
Men who would stand by them through thick and thin
Men who'd go to work everyday and
Bring home their hard earned pay
Men who'd give their woman anything
Their little hearts desired
Where some women make mistakes is
When their men go out and let 'em play they would stay
Because they felt that no other woman wanted him but her
Well listen: if you think no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the street and you will see
Some woman will have your man
Before you can count 1: 2: 3
Yes she will: yes she will"
86,Animals,We Gotta Get Out Of This Place,"In this dirty old part of the city

My little girl: you're so young and pretty

88,Rolling Stones,The Last Time,"Well: I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

Well: this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time: I don't know
Oh no: oh no

Well: I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
There's too much pain and too much sorrow
I guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well: this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time: I don't know
Oh no: oh no

Well: this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time: I don't know

Well: I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
'Cause I'll be gone a long: long time

89,Lovin' Spoonful,Do You Believe In Magic,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you 'bout the magic and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll

If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find how you got there
So: just blow your mind

If you believe in magic come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow: sorta late at night
And we'll go dancing: baby: then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me: yeah

Do you believe in magic
Yeah: believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock 'n' roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh: talkin' 'bout the magic

(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe: believer
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic"
90,Cher,All I Really Want To Do,"Now I ain't lookin' to compete with you
Beat on: cheat on: mistreat you
Simplify you: classify you
Deny: defy: mystify you

All I really want to do
Is: baby: be friends with you
Baby: be friends with you

Now I ain't lookin' to fight with you
Frighten you or uptighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down

All I really want to do
Is: baby: be friends with you
Baby: be friends with you

I ain't lookin' to block you up
Dock or rock or lock you up
Analyze you: categorize you
Finalize or advertise you

All I really want to do
Is: baby: be friends with you
Baby: be friends with you

I don't want to straight-face you up
Race or chase or track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you

All I really want to do
Is: baby: be friends with you
Baby: be friends with you

Now I don't want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you

All I really want to do
Is: baby: be friends with you
Baby: be friends with you"
91,Little Anthony and The Imperials,Take Me Back,"Written by: Teddy Randazzo
#16 Jun '65 Hot 100

Take me back: I'm begging please
Take me back: I'm on my knees
For you to scold me
Hurt me: hold me
Darling: take me back

When you belonged to me
I had a jealous mind
Too late I learned that you
Were not the cheating kind

My jealous eyes have learned
To take a look or two
They were too blind to see
That I was losing you

They say you live and learn
And though I've tried before
I promise never to
Be jealous any more"
92,Strangeloves,I Want Candy,"I know a girl who's soft and sweet
She's so fine: she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want Candy: I want Candy

Go to see her with her hair hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet: she makes my mouth water

I want Candy: I want Candy
I want Candy: I want Candy: I want Candy
Hey: hey: hey: hey

Candy on the beach: there's nothing better
But I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make her mine
Then I'll have Candy all the time

I want Candy: I want Candy
Woo
Hey (repeat and fade)"

94,Sonny,Laugh At Me,
95,Roy Head,Treat Her Right,
96,Jack Jones,The Race Is On,"I feel tears well in up from deep inside
Like my heart's goin' to break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was takin' it hard
Since you gave me the final goodbye
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and cry

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

One day I ventured in love: never once suspectin'
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'
And find that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For the name of the one that I'll never replaced
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all"

99,Del Shannon,Keep Searchin',"No one will understand what I've gotta do
I've gotta find a place to hide with my baby by my side
She's been hurt so much: they treat her mean and cruel
They try to keep us far apart: there's only one thing left we can do

We gotta keep searchin': searchin': find a place to hide
Searchin': searchin': she'll be by my side
If we gotta keep on the run: we'll follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh

Doesn't matter: doesn't matter what people might say
She's mine: and I'm gonna take her anyway

Gotta keep searchin': searchin': find a place to stay
Searchin': searchin': every night and day
If we gotta keep on the run: we'll follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh

We gotta keep searchin': searchin': find a place to hide
Searchin': searchin': she'll be by my side
If we gotta keep on the run: we'll follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah: whee-ooh
Follow the sun"
100,Marvin Gaye,How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),"How sweet it is to be loved by you: yes: baby: ooh
How sweet it is to be loved by you

Ooh baby: I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were

With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions
I want to stop (stop) and thank you: baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you: baby

Hey now
How sweet it is to be loved by you: oh baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you: yes it is

I close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did: seems I'd done them before

But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (stop) and thank you: baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you: baby

Yeah
How sweet it is to be loved by you: oh yes it is: baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you: yes it is: baby: mm

You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me: there's you and nobody else
Stop (stop) and thank you: baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you: baby

Oh
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Tell the truth: baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Well: it's like sugar in my soul
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh: yes it is"
