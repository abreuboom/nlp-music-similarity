1,Three Dog Night,Joy To The World,"Jeremiah was a bull frog
Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said
But I helped him a-drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine

Singin' joy to the world
All the boys and girls: now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you

Singin' now
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider
A straight-shootin' son of a gun
I said a straight shootin' son of a gun

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the world
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world: yeah yeah
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
Joy to you and me

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me

You know I mean joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me"
2,Rod Stewart,Maggie May / (Find A) Reason To Believe,"Wake up: Maggie: I think I got something to say to you
It's late September: and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie: I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart: and that's what really hurts

The morning sun: when it's in your face: really shows your age
But that don't worry me none: in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie: I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul: and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover: and: mother: what a lover: you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie: I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart: I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie: I wish I'd never seen your face

You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart: but I love you anyway

Maggie: I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days"
3,Carole King,It's Too Late / I Feel The Earth Move,"Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here: there can be no denyin'
One of us is changing or maybe we've just stopped tryin'

And it's too late: baby: now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no: no: no: no (no: no: no: no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late: baby: now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no: no

There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together: don't you feel it too
Still: I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late: baby: now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it now)
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no: no: no: no: no

It's too late: baby
It's too late: now darling
It's too late"
4,Osmonds,One Bad Apple,"Yeah: yeah

I can tell you've been hurt
By that look on your face: girl
Some guy brought sadness
Into your happy world

You need love
But you're afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And sock it to you again

One bad apple don't
Spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh: give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple don't
Spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh: I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard

I could make you happy: baby
Satisfy you too (satisfy you now)
But how can I if you
Won't give me a chance
To prove my love to you

Won't you just give me one
Little chance (one little chance now)
I'll give you love's guarantee
That you won't be hurt again

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh: give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh: I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now

I've been noticing you: baby
For a long: long time (long: long time now)
I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That you really messed up my mind

Girl: to me
You're like a dream come true (dream come true now)
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to ever hurt you

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh: give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh: I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch: girl
No: give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch: girl
Oh now: I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now"
5,Bee Gees,How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
La-la la-la-la

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

Da da da-da la-la: la-la-da-da
La-la la-la la-da-la

Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

La-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da: da-da-da da-da-da"
6,Raiders,Indian Reservation,"They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife

Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud you lived
So proud you died

They took the whole Indian nation
Locked us on this reservation
Though I wear a shirt and tie
I'm still part redman deep inside

Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud you lived
So proud you died

But maybe someday when we've learned
Cherokee nation will return
Will return: will return
Will return: will return"
7,Donny Osmond,Go Away Little Girl,"Go away little girl
Go away little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you

I know that your lips are sweet
but our lips must never meet
I'm dating somebody else and I must be true

Oh: go away little girl (go away little girl)
Go away little girl (go away little girl)
It's hurting me more each minute that we delay

When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away little girl
Before I beg you to stay

(Go away little girl) Go away little girl
(Go away little girl) Oh: go away little girl
(It hurts me more the more that we delay)

When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So: go away little girl
Let's call it a day little girl
Please: go away little girl
Before I beg you to stay

(Go away) Go away little girl
(Go away) Go away little girl
(Go away) Please: go away little girl
(Go away) Go away little girl

8,John Denver,"Take Me Home, Country Roads","Almost heaven: West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains: Shenandoah River
Life is old there: older than the trees
Younger than the mountains: growing like a breeze

Country roads: take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia: Mountain Mama
Take me home: country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady: stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty: painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine: teardrop in my eye

Country roads: take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia: Mountain Mama
Take me home: country roads

I hear her voice: in the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road: I get a feelin
That I should have been home yesterday: yesterday

Country roads: take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia: Mountain Mama
Take me home: country roads

Country roads: take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia: Mountain Mama
Take me home: country roads
Take me home: (down) country roads
Take me home: (down) country roads"
9,Temptations,Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me),"Mm: hmm: mm
Ooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself: you're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellas in the world: she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
Ooh-ooh: ooh: hoo (so)

Soon we'll be married and raise a family (oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children: maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination once again
Running away with me
Telling you it was just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord: hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I would surely die

Mm: her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

Just my imagination once again
Running away with me
Oh: tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her: but I can't forget her

Just my imagination: ooh: yeah: yeah: yeah: yeah
Running away with me
Ooh: just my imagination
Running away with me"
10,Dawn,Knock Three Times,"Hey girl: whatcha doing down there
Dancing alone every night while I live right above you
I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me: you don't even know me
I love you

Oh: my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mm: twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh: my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa: twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show

If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note that's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart

Oh: my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mm: twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh: my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa: twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show

Whoa: I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me: you don't even know me
I love you

Oh: my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mm: twice on the pipe if the answer is no (I love you: I love you)
Oh: my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mm: twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show

Oh: my darling
Knock three times"
11,Janis Joplin,Me And Bobby McGee,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge: waitin' for a train
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
And rode us all the way into New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin': it ain't nothin' honey: if it ain't free
And feelin' good was easy: Lord: when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah: Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather: through everything we done
Yeah: Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas: Lord: I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin': and that's all that Bobby left me
Well feelin' good was easy: Lord: when he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee: yeah

12,Al Green,Tired Of Being Alone,"I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can?

People say that I've found a way
To make you say that you love me

19,Lee Michaels,Do You Know What I Mean,"Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know: know what I mean?

I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her: asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord: Do you know what I mean?

Her and Bobby were steppin' out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know: know what I mean?

So I asked her if she still cared
She didn't hear me: she just stared
Do you know what I mean?
Lord: Do you know what I mean?

And then she said
Lee you haven't loved me in nearly four years
You haven't noticed that I held back my tears
And now you have: but it's really too late
Better find yourself another girl
Better find another girl
Better find uh: another place

She just left me yesterday
She just left me: had nothing to say

20,Joan Baez,The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"Virgil Caine is my name and I drove on the Danville train
Till Stonewall's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65: we were hungry: just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember: oh: so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went: na na na na na: na na na na

Back with my wife in Tenessee
And one day she said to me:
Virgil: quick come see
There goes the Robert E. Lee
Now I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went: na na na na na: na na na na

Like my father before me: I'm a working man
And like my brother before me: I took a rebel stand
Oh: he was just 18: proud and brave
But a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went: na na na na na: na na na na"

24,Five Man Electrical Band,Signs,"And the sign said
""Long-haired freaky people

So I took off my hat and said: ""Imagine that
Huh: me workin' for you""
Whoa

Breakin' my mind
Do this: don't do that

And the sign said
""Anybody caught trespassin'
Will be shot on sight""
So I jumped on the fence and I yelled at the house
""Hey! What gives you the right
To put up a fence to keep me out
But to keep Mother Nature in?
If God was here: he'd tell you to your face
'Man: you're some kind of sinner'""

You can't even watch: no: you can't eat
You ain't supposed to be here
The sign said: ""You've got to have a membership card
To get inside""
Uh!

And the sign said
""Everybody welcome
Come in: kneel down and pray""
But when they passed around the plate at the end of it all
I didn't have a penny to pay
So I got me a pen and a paper
And I made up my own little sign
I said: ""Thank you: Lord: for thinkin' 'bout me
I'm alive and doin' fine""
Woo!

28,Jerry Reed,Amos Moses,"Yeah: here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligators for a livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get ya: Amos
It ain't legal hunting alligators down in the swamp: boy

Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist: and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana bayou

About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodaux: Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest: the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left 'cause the alligator bit it
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow

Well the sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins
So he snuck in the swamp: gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well: I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to
Well: you can sure get lost in a Louisiana bayou

About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodaux: Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well: they raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses"

33,Ocean,Put Your Hand In The Hand,"Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea

By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Every time I look into the Holy Book I want to tremble (tremble)
Or when I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple (temple)
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellas than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know we're not the people we should be

So: put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

My mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
She said: ""there'll come a time when there'll probably be room in heaven""
But I'm feeling kinda guilty 'bout the number of times to do what we must do
But we forget what he said: then we figure that he'll still make room

So: you gotta put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Everybody come along

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water

Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea

34,Daddy Dewdrop,Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It),"Last night I had a crazy dream
About a chick in a black bikini
Oh she looked so good she couldn't be real
So she must be a magic genie
But then she disappeared around a corner
All I saw were three doors and the top of her bikini
I made it through the first door there was a party going on
I asked about the chick but what they said was this

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom

I found the bottom half
Behind the second door
Which took me to Africa I presume
This really far out cat was screaming half crazy
""Bomp boom a loo bom a long bam boo""
I said hey man cut that jive
And tell me where the chick went
But he looked at me as pleased as could be
And said a lotta words but I wonder what he meant

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom

Ah don't ya jes' love it
Ooh don't ya jes' love it
Don't ya love it: don't ya love it
Oh yeah: don't ya jes' love it
Don't ya jes' love it

Now I opened the third door and there she was
And she whispered so sexy oh ooh
I tried to do the same and impress her with my style
But why this chick would never know

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it

We've got a lifetime to share so much to say

36,Gordon Lightfoot,If You Could Read My Mind,"If you could read my mind: love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind: love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now: love: let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind: love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back"
37,Sammi Smith,Help Me Make It Through The Night,"Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft against your skin

Come and lay down by my side
'Til the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

I don't care what's right or wrong
And I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
'Cause tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the night"
38,Carpenters,Rainy Days And Mondays,"Talking to myself and feeling old
Sometimes I'd like to quit
Nothing ever seems to fit
Hanging around

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

What I've got they used to call the blues
Nothing is really wrong
Feeling like I don't belong
Walking around
Some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

Funny but it seems I always wind up here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me

What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out
We know what it's all about
Hanging around
Nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me

What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out

Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take: you gotta give: so live and let live and let go: oh: oh: oh: oh
I beg your pardon: I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well: if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter?
So smile for a while and let's be jolly; love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap; still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly; love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon: I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine: there's gotta be a little rain sometime

And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy

Please remember peace is how we make it
Here within your reach: if you're big enough to take it

I don't ask for much: I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it don't come easy"
44,Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Mr. Bojangles,"I knew a man: Bojangles: and he'd dance for you 
In worn out shoes 
Silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe 
He jumped so high: he jumped so high 
And then he'd lightly touch down 

I met him in a cell in New Orleans: I was 
Down and out 
He looked to me to be the eyes of age 
As the smoke ran out 
He talked of life: he talked of life 
He laughed: clicked his heels and stepped 

He said his name: Bojangles: and he danced a lick 
Across the cell 
He grabbed his pants: and favorite stance: oh: he jumped so high 
And then he clicked his heels 
He let go a laugh: he let go a laugh 
Shook back his clothes all around 

Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles 
Mr. Bojangles 
Dance 

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs 
Throughout the south 
He spoke through tears of fifteen years: how his dog and him 
Traveled about 
The dog up and died: he up and died 
After twenty years he still grieves 

He said: ""I dance now at every chance in honky tonks 
For drinks and tips 
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit""
He shook his head: and as he shook his head 
I heard someone ask him please: please 

Mr. Bojangles 
Mr. Bojangles 
Mr. Bojangles 
Dance"

47,Carly Simon,That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be,"My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I walk by: no remark

I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
I hear her call ""sweet dreams""
But I forget how to dream

But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own: you and me
Well: that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me: we'll marry

My friends from college: they're all married now
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Tearful nights: angry dawns

Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
And yet they drink: they laugh
Close the wound: hide the scar

But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own: you and me
Well: that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me: we'll marry

You say that we can keep our love alive
Babe: all I know is what I see
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris

You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
By myself

Well okay: it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own: you and me
Well: that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me: we'll marry
(We'll marry)"

(A rose in black at Spanish Harlem)

It is the special one
It never sees the sun
It only comes up
When the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft sweet and dreamy

(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)
(A rose in black at Spanish Harlem)

With eyes as black as coal
That look down in his soul
It start a fire there and then he loses control
I'm gonna beg his par-ar-ar-ardon yeah
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In his garden

(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem uum uum)

What to do: how to move him
I've been changed: yes really changed
In these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else

I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man: he's just a man
And I've had so many men before 
In very many ways
He's just once more

Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm: so cool: no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so

Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about

Yes: if he said he loved me
I'd be lost: I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope: just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head: I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him so"

Climb up a string for you

But I dare not to make a sound

'Cause I'm so afraid
You will cast me away
Like a beat up: worn out toy

So I hold on tight
With all my might just
To be your loving boy: yeah

No matter what they say or do
I gotta bounce right
Back to you now

53,Partridge Family,Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted,"I go downtown and roam all around
But every street I walk: I find another dead end
I'm on my own but I'm so all alone
I need somebody so I won't have to pretend

I know there's someone just waiting somewhere
I look around for her but she's just not there

Oh: doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me: where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me: just like me

I'm running free but I don't want to be
I couldn't take another day like yesterday
I'm dead on my feet from walking the street
I need somebody to help me find my way

I've gotta get out of this town
Before I do I'll take a last look around

Oh: doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me: where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me: just like me

You know: I'm no different from anybody else
I start each day and end each night
But it gets real lonely when you're by yourself
Now where is love and who is love: I gotta know

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me: where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me: just like me

Working for the man ev'ry night and day

Then I never lost a minute of sleep
When worrying 'bout the way that things
Might have been

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city

Till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river

If you come down to the river

Betcha gonna find the people who live

You don't have to worry though you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheels keep on turning

How he makes me smile
With all this love I have to give him
I guess I'm gonna stay with him awhile

She brushes the curls from my eyes
She drops her robe on the floor
And she reaches for the light on the bureau
And the darkness is her pillow once more

How she makes me quiver
How she makes me smile

59,Lobo,Me And You And A Dog Named Boo,"I remember to this day
The bright red Georgia clay
How it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Willpower made that old car go
A women's mind told me that's so
Oh how I wish we were back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I can still recall
The wheat fields of Saint Paul
And the morning we got caught robbing from an old hen
Old MacDonald: he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I'll never forget the day
We motored stately into big L.A.
The lights of the city put settling down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's bugging us to go
We gotta get away and get back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man"

Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings
Stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day

At the office where the papers grow she takes a break
Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

So sad: so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah: stay: don't stand her up
And he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day: so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

As she posts another letter to the sound of five
People gather 'round her and she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day

So sad: so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away"

So sweet and cautiously he chased my love
A devil in disguise: he fooled my heart
Tricked me into the dark: ""Hold up!"" - I was shocked
Pulled his charms: took me in his arms
Stole my love: and now he's gone

I'll set a tender trap: he'll be unaware
I'll wear a smile down the aisle

What a handsome lad: that's my boy
B-R-L-F-Q spells mom and dad
Well that ain't too bad: 'cause that's my boy
Well you can have your TV and your nightclubs
And you can have your drive-in - picture show
I'll stay here with my little man near
We'll listen to the radio
Biding my time watching Scotty grow

Making a castle out of building blocks
And a cardboard box: that's my boy
Micky Mouse says it's thirteen o'clock
Well that's quite a shock: but that's my boy
In four short years I've gone from rags to riches
And what I did before that: I don't know
So let it rain on my windowpane
I got my own rainbow
And we're sitting here shining:
Watching Scotty grow

Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed
Old sleepyhead: that's my boy
Gotta have a drink of water and a story read
A teddybear named Fred: that's my boy
What's that you say momma: come on and keep your feet warm?
Well save me a place I'll be there in a minute or so
I think I'll stay right here
And say a little prayer before I go
Me and God are watching Scotty grow
Me and God are watching Scotty grow"
79,Matthews' Southern Comfort,Woodstock,"I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
When I asked him: ""where are you going?""
This he told me
I'm going down to Yasgur's farm
Think I'll join a rock and roll band
I'll camp out on the land
I'll try and set my soul free

We are stardust: we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

Well: then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel just like a cog 
In something turning
Well maybe it's the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life's for learning

We are stardust: we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

By the time I got to Woodstock
They were half a million strong
Everywhere there were songs and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies above our nation

We are stardust: we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

We are stardust: we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

We are stardust: we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden"
80,Judy Collins,Amazing Grace,"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost: but now am found: 
Was blind: but now can see. 

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear: 
And grace my Fears relieved; 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed! 

Through many dangers: toils and snares:
I have already come; 
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far: 
And grace will lead me home. 

And when we've been there ten thousand years: 
Bright shining as the sun: 
We'll have no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun."

And now you're telling me all your lies

Go back where you've been

You better get back to your used-to-be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me

Looks any different to me

And you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never: no: no: no stop loving you

If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never: never: never stop loving you
If I were your woman
You're sweet lovin' woman

If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman...

...You'd need no other woman"
91,Neil Diamond,I Am..I Said,
92,Paul Stookey,Wedding Song (There Is Love),"He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts
Rest assured: this troubadour is acting on His part
The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name
There is love: there is love

Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning is now and 'til the end
Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again
And there is love: there is love

Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife
Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life
For if loving is the answer: then who's the giving for
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before
Oh there's love: oh there's love

Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name
There is love: oh there's love"

95,Richie Havens,Here Comes The Sun,"Here comes the sun: here comes the sun
And I say it's alright

Little darling: it's been a long: cold: lonely winter
Little darling: it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun: here comes the sun
And I say it's alright

Little darling: the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling: it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun: here comes the sun
And I say it's alright

Sun: sun: sun: here it comes
Sun: sun: sun: here it comes
Sun: sun: sun: here it comes
Sun: sun: sun: here it comes
Sun: sun: sun: here it comes

Little darling: I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling: it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun: here comes the sun
And I say it's alright
It's alright"

Wo-op wa-dooba-do wop-wop-wop wo-op

Sweet Mary sent a letter to me
She say to ""Hurry home
I need you right away.
I've got a stomach full of love
And I'm all alone
All of the day""

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you: hey-ey!
Sweet Mary I'm coming home
That's the least I can do.

Sweet Mary in that letter to me
She said ""It's up to you
I need you right away""
And now I got to hop a freight
Back to the farm and all
I've got to be

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you: yeah-hey.
Sweet Mary I'm coming home now
That's the least I can do: babe

Wo-op wa-dooba-do wop. Oh yeah: baby.

Sweet Mary has a smile on her face
You know she's happy to see me wrap her in an embrace
I only hope the passing of time
She'll always feel that way
And I won't pack up my things

Sweet Mary I'm coming home
Coming home to you: yeah: hey
Sweet Mary I'm coming home now
That's the least I can do. Hey

Chickie-chickie-chickie to hop a freight

97,Brenda and The Tabulations,Right On The Tip Of My Tongue,"It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say ""I love you""
It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say ""I love you""

I played the game of love and lost
And now my heart must pay the cost
I had the chance to make you mine: but I wasted too much time
And let your love slip away

It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say ""I love you""
It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say ""I love you""

While I was wondering where to start
She came along and won your heart
With all the tender words of love that I was thinking of
But never bothered to say

Mmm: wait a minute: wait a minute
I've got something to tell you
Don't walk away: baby

It was right on the tip of my tongue
And I forgot to say ""I love you""
It was right on the tip of my tongue
(And I forgot to say) to say: to say...

(Ah: ah: ah: tip of my tongue) my tongue
(Tip of my tongue)

spoken:
Didn't you know? Couldn't you see it?
I tried to tell you... please...?
Don't you understand? I love you...
Don't walk away... oh: please...?"
98,Fifth Dimension,One Less Bell To Answer,"One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy
But all I do is cry

(Cry: cry: no more laughter) 
Oh: I should be happy
(Oh: why did he go)
I only know that since he left
My life's so empty

Though I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
'Cause I still love him so
I end each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out

Oh: one less man to pick up after
No more laughter
No more love
Since he went
Oh: he went away
(e went away)

(One less bell to answer) 
Why did he leave me
(Oh why: why: why did he leave)
(One less bell to answer)
Now I've got one less egg to fry
One less egg to fry
(Oh why: why: why did he leave)
And all I do is cry
(One less bell to answer)
Because my man told me goodbye
(Oh why: why: why did he leave)
(One less bell to answer)
Somebody tell me please
Where did he go: why did he go
(Ohy: why: why did he leave)
Tell me: how could he leave me"

100,Perry Como,It's Impossible,"It's impossible: tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible: ask a baby not to cry 
It's just impossible

Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you going through me
Split the second hat I never think of you
Oh: how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you: could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world: somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you: could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world: somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible
Impossible: mmm
Impossible"
