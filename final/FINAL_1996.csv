I'm not trying to seduce you

Carla Vanessa
When I dance they call me Macarena
And the boys they say que soy buena
They all want me: they can't have me
So they all come and dance beside me

Move with me: chant with me
And if you're good I'll take you home with me
Move with me: chant with me
And if you're good I'll take you home with me

Carla Vanessa
Now don't you worry about my boyfriend
The boy whose name is Vitorino
I don't want him: can't stand him
He was no good so I... ha ha ha ha

Now come on: what was I supposed to do?
He was out of town and his two friends were so fine

2,Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men,One Sweet Day,"Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away: so far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feelin': knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive: alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darlin' I never showed you (no: no: no)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
And I: I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (but I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah: and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(I know you're looking down from heaven)
And I know eventually we'll be together (together we will)
One sweet day

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say"
3,Celine Dion,Because You Loved Me,"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful: baby
You're the one who held me up: never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through: through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me: ooh: baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand: I could touch the sky
I lost my faith: you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love: I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me

Oh: you were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh: when I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me: hey: yeah

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me
Oh: I'm everything I am because you loved me"
4,Tony Rich Project,Nobody Knows,"spoken:
Wish I told her how I felt...
Maybe she'd be here right now.
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say?
How could I let my angel get away?
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly: but you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely: the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me

I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get?
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know: I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely: the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever: ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me

Said when the nights are lonely...

The nights are lonely: the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me"

6,Tracy Chapman,Give Me One Reason,"Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around

Said: I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby: I got your number
Oh: and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too many times

You can call me baby
You can call me anytime: but you got to call me

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )

Said: I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life

I just want someone to hold me
Oh: and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you
Yes: and give you what you need
I said: this youthful heart can love you
Oh: and give you what you need

But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here
Yes: and I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )
Give me one reason to stay here
Oh: I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )

Said: I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby: just give me one reason
Oh: give me just one reason why
Baby: just give me one reason
Oh: give me just one reason why I should stay

Said: I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to say"

8,Donna Lewis,I Love You Always Forever,"Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching: discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air (Summer night: summer night)
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness: soft spoken words
Say: say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far: closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far: closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness: a magical time
Say: say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far: closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever

Because my heart is where your love is at

12,Everything But The Girl,Missing,"I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you: ho
Like the deserts miss the rain

And could you be dead
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run

I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I'm back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging round your old address

And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you: ho oh
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you: yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
(And I miss you)

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
I guess you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you: yeah
And I miss you
You found some better place
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you: yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you: and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you: yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
The deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you: yeah"
13,Alanis Morissette,Ironic,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down: he thought: ""Well: isn't this nice?""
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Well: life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A ""No Smoking"" sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife: hmph
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
A little too ironic: and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

And yeah: oh: life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny: funny way of helping you out
Helping you out"
14,Whitney Houston,Exhale (Shoop Shoop),"Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong and sometimes it's right

Hearts are often broken when there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face: somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself: you're halfway there

15,Gin Blossoms,Follow You Down / Til I Hear It From You,"Well: did you see the sky? I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge: it's just the farthest that I've ever been

Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down: but not that far

I know we're headed somewhere: I can see how far we've come
Well: still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone

Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down: but not that far
Woo!

How you gonna ever find your place?
Running at an artificial pace
Are they here to find us lying face down in the sand?
So: what the hell? Now we've already been forever damned

Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down: but not that far

Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go: I'll follow you down

16,Brandy,Sittin' Up In My Room,"Seems like ever since the first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
Can't seem to forget: can't get you out my head
Guess the verdict's in: I'm crazy over you
How can one be down: tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile: I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern: how can I get with you
Till my day comes: here's what I'm gonna do

Chrous:
Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' 'bout you
I must confess: I'm a mess for you
Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a thang for you

Pray that you'll invest in my happiness
All it takes is just one simple word from you
Turn my heart around: if I'm making ground
Pretty baby please: tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up
You see I need to know
Tell me if I'm far or: if I'm getting close
I have but one concern: and that one concern is you
Till I'm with you: here's what I'm gonna do

(Repeat Chrous)

How can one be down: tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile: I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern: how can I get with you

Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real
How do U want it: yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane: I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes: time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club: oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me: then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway: police catch me if you can

Forgive me I'm a rider: still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money: fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International: playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch: get you anything you ask for

It's either him or me: champagne: Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed: peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed: funk: ya don't need

Approachin' hoochies with a passion: been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby: I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk: am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic: ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics

Up and down like a roller coaster: I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over: 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery: I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me: get her rockin' these

Nights full of Aliz&#xE9;: a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker: you'se a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother

Worse than the others: Bill Clinton: Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions: niggaz top that

They wanna censor me: they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell: only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss: nigga tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?

Raised as a youth: tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager: mobile phone: Sky Pager
Game rules: I'm livin' major: my adversaries

Is lookin' worried: they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high: see the demons in my eyes: before I die

I wanna live my life and ball: make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me

Ha ha ha: but I'mma mash out: peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it: how do U want it?

How do U want it? How does it feel?

18,Celine Dion,It's All Coming Back To Me Now,"There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember when: no way: no how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allowed 
Baby: baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allowed
Baby: baby: baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me...
Now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And if we..."
19,Eric Clapton,Change The World,"If I could reach the stars I'd pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart so you could see the truth
That this love I have inside is everything it seems
But for now I find it's only in my dreams

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby: if I could: change the world

If I could be king: even for a day
I'd take you as my queen: I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule this kingdom we have made
Till then I'll be a fool: wishin' for the day

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby: if I could change the world
Baby: if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby: if I could change the world
Baby: if I could change the world
Baby: if I could change the world"
20,LL Cool J,Hey Lover,"I've been watchin' you from afar:
For as long as I can remember.
You're all a real man can need:
And ever asked for
This is love girl.
This is more than a crush: yeah.

It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw ya witcha man
Smiling: huh: a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the Coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment: and that was that
So I skated off: as you strolled off
Looking at the legs: god damn: they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man: that's my mission
If this love is real: he's got to handle competition
You only knew him 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drink too much: and smoke too many blunts
And I be working out everyday thinking 'bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it: I ain't had a crush in years: hey lover

Hey lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush
Lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush
Hey lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush (2x)

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
And I don't wanna violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tounging you down with: huh: vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs under the moonlight
Searching your body with my tongue girl all night
I wonder one day could it be: simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you'd follow I'll lead
Hey lover

Hey lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush
Lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush
Hey lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush (2x)

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin my wife no longer my girl
Then: you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless: currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But it's a fantasy it won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Hey lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush
Lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush
Hey lover: hey lover: this is more than a crush (2x)"

So in the darkness: I can run my tongue over your tits
It's all good sugary: you ain't leavin'
Sit up on my face and help my stash grow even
Whipped cream taste mean from the back

We speak daily on the regular
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica: pretty white sand
Suntan oil: pina colada in you hand
Layin' up at night: peepin' out stars
Remember when we was at the club at the bar?
I told ya my status was that of a don
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on
But my mind has attractin' qualities
On the emotions of a young lady (word up)
So here you are: smack dab up in the mix (uh-huh)

You'd know anywhere?

Oh: I really should've known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes: your casual goodbyes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face that told me
Maybe you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

Insensitive

How do you numb your skin: after the warmest touch?
How do you slow your blood: after the body rush?
How do you free your soul: after you've found a friend?  
How do you teach your heart it's a crime to fall in love again?

Oh: you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue: I'm out of touch
I fell too fast: I feel too much

On how to be insensitive

24,Goo Goo Dolls,Name,"And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame

But if you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
Reruns all become our history

A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name

Mmm: mmm
I won't tell 'em your name
Ow

Mmmmmm

I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are; come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name"

They say they're better than you and you agree

Says come here boys: there's nothing for free
Another doctor's bill: a lawyer's bill: another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put him in your will: but...

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers?
Who will save your soul after those lies that you told: boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La da de da de da la da da

We try to hustle them: try to bustle them: try to cuss them
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day: another dollar: another war: another tower went up
Where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin but...

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers?
Who will save your soul after those lies that you told: boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La da de da de da la da da

Some are walkin': some are talkin': some are stalkin their kill
You got social security: but that don't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil: but you're okay for today say
That you love them: take their money and run
Say it's been swell: sweetheart: but it was just one of those things
Those flings: those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets: girls: and bust your butts

Who will save... save your soul when it comes to the babies now?
Oh: who will save your soul: after those lies that you told: boy?
And who will save... save your soul if you won't save your own?"
26,No Mercy,Where Do You Go,"Where do you go: my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know: my lovely: I wanna know

Where do you go: oh oh eh oh
I wanna know: oh oh eh oh
Where do you go: oh oh eh oh...
I wanna know...

You leave without a word: no message: no number
And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder
You left me with a heartache deep inside
Girl you should see me cry all night: and I wonder

Everybody says: what a shame: what is wrong
They don't like the game we play
Heard you're hanging round every night until dawn
I'm waiting for you night and day

Where do you go: my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know: my lovely: I wanna know

Where do you go: oh oh eh oh
I wanna know: oh oh eh oh
Where do you go: oh oh eh oh...
I wanna know...

You gotta break the silence: don't keep me waiting
Just like a river flowing to the sea
You are running back to me
Come back and save me

Where do you go: My Lovely
I wanna know

Where do you go: oh oh oh...
Where do you go: oh oh oh...
I wanna know

Na na na na nida: na na nida da da dee da
Na na na na nida: na na nida da da dee da

Where do you: where do you go?...
Where do you: where do you go?...

Save me...

Come back and dry the tears: I cried for you baby
You've gotta stop this heartache deep inside
You've gotta help me make it through the night safely
Come back and save me

Where do you go: my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know: my lovely: I wanna know
Where do you go: my lovely
Where do you go...

27,R. Kelly,I Can't Sleep Baby (If I),"Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end: it was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby: bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe: I can't think babe: I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should of had my trust in you from the very start darlin'
'Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things that he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby - bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe: I can't think babe: I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Baby can we meet somewhere and talk about it
Oh baby: can we work it out
I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I

I can't sleep babe: I can't think babe: I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

28,Dishwalla,Counting Blue Cars,"Must've been mid-afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and
He walked with a purpose
In his sneakers: down the street
He had many questions
Like children often do
He said:

""Tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me: am I very far?""

Must've been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars
Skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions
Like children often do
We said:

Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far
Am I very far now?

It's getting cold: picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions
Like children often do

Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me: am I very far?
We're not very far now
We're not very far now (Tell me all your thoughts on God)
We're not very far now

29,Alanis Morissette,You Learn / You Oughta Know,"I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
I recommend walking around naked in your living room: yeah

It feels so good (Swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles

You live: you learn
You love: you learn
You cry: you learn
You lose: you learn
You bleed: you learn
You scream: you learn

I recommend biting off more that you can chew to anyone (I certainly do)
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time (Feel free)
Throw it down (The caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (To the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears 

You live: you learn
You love: you learn
You cry: you learn
You lose: you learn
You bleed: you learn
You scream: you learn

Wear it out (The way a three-year-old would do)
Melt it down (You're gonna have to eventually anyway)
The fire trucks are coming up around the bend 

You live: you learn
You love: you learn
You cry: you learn
You lose: you learn
You bleed: you learn

If God had a name: what would it be?

If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

And yeah: yeah: God is great
Yeah: yeah: God is good
Yeah: yeah: yeah: yeah: yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face: what would it look like?
And would you want to see?
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets?

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus

He's tryin' to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope: maybe: in Rome

Back up to Heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make His way home

Nobody callin' on the phone

31,Natalie Merchant,Wonder,"Doctors have come from distant cities just to see me
Stand over my bed disbelieving what they're seeing
They say I must be one of the wonders of God's own creation
And as far as they see they can offer no explanation

Newspapers ask intimate questions want confessions
They reach into my head to steal the glory of my story
They say I must be one of the wonders of God's own creation
And as far as they see they can offer no explanation

Ooh: I believe Fate smiled and Destiny
Laughed as she came to my cradle
Know this child will be able
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love with patience and with faith
She'll make her way
She'll make her way

People see me I'm a challenge to your balance
I'm over your heads how I confound you and astound you to know
I must be one of the wonders of God's own creation
And as far as you see you can offer me no explanation

Ooh: I believe Fate smiled and Destiny
Laughed as she came to my cradle
Know this child will be able
Laughed as she came to my mother
Know this child will not suffer
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love with patience and with faith
She'll make her way
She'll make her way
She'll make her way"
32,Mary J. Blige,Not Gon' Cry,"While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids: I have nothing to show
Wasted my years: a fool of a wife
I should've left your ass long time ago

Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears: stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees
In love: you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health
'Til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our heart
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears: stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No: I'm not gon' cry: it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well: I'm not gon' cry: I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears

Mase be the one that will take you home
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone
All you days alone I could make you moan
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce
Bad boy get more money than you can count
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce
I'd do it to your cat for a large amount
And when the beef come you know where to be found
Why I be around till the winner is announced (*Puff : The winner is...*)
So there ya go girl with thousands in ya palms
Why you can't let by gones be by gones

It's filled with so much color and the laughter we left behind...

Deep down inside: I apologize...

And people come from miles around
With an almost religious devotion
To get on down.

Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

What up everybody so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps: 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street: you gotta feel my beat: so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O: L: I: O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party: so let a nigga know
1: 2: 3: it's like A-B-C
If hip hop didn't pay: I'd rap for free

Gotta Gotta get up to get down

If you got beef: then nigga eat a porkchop
Once I get it goin': you know it don't stop
I brake like antilocks: panties drop:
From hood to hood: block to block
Help: I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it: take your time do it right:
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wonder: but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a Jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on: now whatcha gonna do: so
Grab your partner: do-si-do:
If you don't know who it is: it's Coolio:

Push: push: in the bush
But don't step on no toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to get 'em
So move your body baby: drive the homeys crazy:
The way you shake that ass: it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches: then you gotta give a nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open
Slide: slide: but that's the past

Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering

All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh: it's the world I know

I drink myself a new found pity
Sittin' alone in New York City
And I don't know why
I don't know why

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh: it's the world I know

Yeah: I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh: it's the world I know"

43,3t,Anything,"I'll give you love
The things you want
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything: girl: anything for you
Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I could hold you tight
Pain in my heart
Because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to go
When I would do anything for you: I would
Thinking of ways
That I can win your heart
But: I'm so confused
I don't know where to start
Visions of love
Forever in my mind
I wait for the day when
I can say that girl's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you: yes I would
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby: there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you

What will it take
Because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you go

44,Smashing Pumpkins,1979,"Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet

Junebug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust: I guess
Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care: as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
Lamented and assured to the lights

And towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust: I guess
Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see: there's no one around"
45,TLC,Diggin' On You,"I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there
So was I
In the park: 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chili came to relay that you had a thang for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off
Lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am...

*Chorus* Repeat 2x
Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby bay-ooh-baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
Whatn't gonn' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly coversations
Had no time for new relation-
Ships
I must admit to you
When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
This time you have turned me on
Lights off
Lights on
I guess the groove is on: and I am...

Oh: why do I feel the way I do?
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin
On you
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line
That made me fall for you?
Do you know...
Why I'm diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
On you?

Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
On you

And I am..."

By holding me: and kissing me
Lets them know that for sure

Yes: you don't ever say I'm too young thank you baby

Can do what you're doing to me

49,Mariah Carey,Fantasy,"When you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Baby: I'm so into you
Darling: if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet: sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream

Creep into me slowly
As you go into my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over

And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but
I'm not sleeping

50,Hootie and The Blowfish,Time,"Time: why you punish me?
Like a wave crashing into the shore
You wash away my dreams
Time: why you walk away?
Like a friend with somewhere to go
You left me crying

Can you teach me about tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow: running free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in time

Time: I don't understand
Children killing in the street
Dying for the color of a rag
Time: take their red and blue
Wash them in the ocean: make them clean
Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight

Can you teach me about tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow: running free?
But tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in...

Time is wastin': time is walkin'
(Time: time) You ain't no friend of mine
(Time: time) I don't know where I'm goin'
(Time: time) I think I'm out of my mind...
Thinkin' about time

Just lay me down to sleep

Time is wastin': time is walkin'
(Time: time) You ain't no friend of mine
(Time: time) I don't know where I'm goin'
(Time: time) I think I'm out of my mind...
Thinkin' about time

Time: you left me standing there:
Like a tree growin' all alone
The wind just stripped me bare: stripped me bare
Time: the past has come and gone
The future's far away
Well: now only lasts for one second: one second

Can you teach me about tomorrow:
And all the pain and sorrow: running free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day:
And I don't believe in time

51,Madonna,You'll See,"You think that I can't live without your love
You'll see
You think I can't go on another day
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see
Somehow: some way

You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see
You think that you destroyed my faith in love
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see
Somehow: some day

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive

All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

You think that you are strong but you are weak
You'll see
It takes more strength to cry: admit defeat
I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see
Somehow: some day

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive

52,Az Yet,Last Night,"Last night you were so in to it
You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
Yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you taste mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun: the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night: there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explore
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun: the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Sunlight: red red roses
The scent of you: it calms the heart
The sight of you: I fall apart
Moonlight: the things we notice
When we're in love: that's when it comes
And I'm so I'm so in love

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun: the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun: the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun: the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you"
53,Merril Bainbridge,Mouth,"I feel like I've been blown apart
There are pieces here
I don't know where they go
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips
I bet you feel a little crazy: but for me
We'll be famous on TV

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down: don't want to waste it

I jump on you: you jump on me
You push me out and even though you know I love you
I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth

When I kiss your salty lips
You will feel a little crazy: but for me
I'll be famous on TV

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down: don't want to waste it

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down: don't want to waste it

Now: will it be my fault if I
Take your love and throw it wide?
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart
All the pieces there will fit to make you whole
And I know where they go

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down: don't want to waste it
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it

Turn you upside down: don't want to waste it
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down
Don't want to waste it"

I could not see
All the beauty and wonder
Wrapping around me
I was alone
Dreaming of you
Oh I could not imagine
This dream coming true

So much joy now
In all that I touched
You make me feel
Everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain

Facing the wind
Tears from my eyes
Baby: where have you been
When I was hoping
Was waiting for you
To pull back the door
To take me by the hand
And lead me through

This whole world was
A stranger to me
Now you have opened
My heart to everything

spoken:
Like a whisper in a dream
You've walked softly into my life
With love and sweet emotion
And as I gaze into your eyes
I see the beauty that God has created
And I love you girl
Now and forever"

I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand

I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt

59,Outkast,Elevators (Me and You),
60,Blues Traveler,Hook,"It doesn't matter what I say
As long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel that I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection

But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job: it's your resolve that breaks

Because the hook brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact: I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near

To confuse the issue: I'll refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow

Was that the hook brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

Suck it in: suck it in: suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see what you're doing to me 
This MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So desperately I'll sing to thee of love
Sure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried: well: no: in fact: I lied
Could be financial suicide but I got too much pride inside
To hide or slide: I'll do as I'll decide
And let it ride until I've died and only then shall I abide
This tide of catchy little tunes: of hip three-minute ditties
I want to bust all your balloons
I want to burn all of your cities to the ground
I found I will not mess around unless I play
Then hey: I will go on all day: hear what I say

I won't bore you with the details: baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby: I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes: it's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fast love: is all that I've got on my mind

What's there to think about baby?

But I just want to have some fun

I won't bore you with the detail baby
You gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe: you could help
To ease my mind: baby: I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes: it's more than enough
Had some bad love
Some fast love: is all that I've got on my mind

So close I can taste it now baby: so close

In the absence of security: I made my way into the night
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me
And I see lovin' in his eyes
I miss my baby: oh yeah: I miss my baby tonight
So why don't we make a little room
In my BMW: babe: searchin' for some peace of mind
Hey: I'll help you find it

Oh: I'm just a girl: all pretty and petite

I can't do the little things I hold so dear

Cause I'm just a girl: I'd rather not be
Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh: I'm just a girl: guess I'm some kind of freak
Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh: I'm just a girl: take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

Oh: I've had it up to here

Oh: am I making myself clear
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

Oh: I'm just a girl living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh: I'm just a girl: what's my destiny
What I've succumbed to is making me numb

She whispers in his ear: boy: you are my star

In the bone-colored dawn: me and Gypsy Scotty are singin'

He just made that story up: there ain't no girl like that

Put on a poncho: played for mosquitoes
And drank till I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle: Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and fan

Well: okay I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down: real low down
You listen to Coltrane: derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round: around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed: scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well: okay I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

We've been far: far away from here
Put on a poncho: played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in between
Well: okay we get along

In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though i am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot: barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Oh: darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)

Surely I can: if you the man.
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice.
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang
Get it on.
You're gettin' warm.

Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I procede to Open up and feed you.
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be.
Been I can: I get rid of all company.

Many have tried strict regulation.
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation.
Those that didn't perform well.
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell.
You're playing with my time.
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me.
You better work me.
While you got the oppurtunity.
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E.
Only the strong survive.
Only the wise excel.
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly.
Left all alone try to control me.
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets.
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute.
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot.
But it's all good: though you gotta get it when you want it.
Like your prey: make your move and hop up on it.
It's natural. Never be ashamed.
Fuck the fame. Get the name: and kick the game."

How could you turn your back on me? Oh...

(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?)

I gave: gave everything a man could ever need;
I was there whenever you would call me: baby...
But somehow: your feelings changed: you don't act the same;
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes: you promised me that you'd never leave: boy...
Now the love is gone: baby - tell me what went wrong?
How could you leave me hanging on? Oh: baby...

(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me:) Oh: oh: oh...

(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (f you really don't need me:) Oh: no...
(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love?

I once was blind but: baby: now I see: yeah: (Now I see...)
That I'm not the one who can fill your every need... (Fill your need...)
I painted a picture so clear: it's reality; (Reality...)
Now I know: yes: I know: that you're not the one for me...

Oh: baby!
(If you really don't want me: if you really don't need me:) Oh: yeah!
(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?) Who do you love: baby?
(If you really don't want me:) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me:) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?)

How could you walk away from me? Baby: you promised you'd never leave!
Slept alone since you've been gone - the greatest pain I've ever known... (Who do you love?)

(If you really don't want me...) Oh: baby: oh: baby: oh: yeah...
(If you really don't love me: then who do you love?) Oh: oh: baby!

(If you really don't want me: if you really don't need me:) If you don't love me...

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart: my heart

Take back that sad word: ""goodbye""
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart: my heart: ooh

Just bring the weed: we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with 2 protections
I put the phone in the hook: then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the hoe: really doe
To the crib.

I know you wanna try it out: to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
While she lie back: now muthafucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your hoe
Tryin' to come up on another G
The broad all up under me tryin' to smother me
Lookin' lovely while I roll another bead: suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbin' me with lotion
Comin' like an ocean coastin have a cig thinkin' me and Do Or Die dig drinkin' love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be givin' women dick in the bed: until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't trickin the Feds or spittin' game but it's chicken and bread
Kickin' them legs in the air like a player do
Then belittle in a day or 2
After words I'm a slay a crew
Now that's some pimp type shit that B-Low and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a hoe wanna holler then you a player if you hit them ends and get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same hoe to wanna freak your friends
'Cause I studied P I M P ology: but logically
Be learnin' these hoes biology: obviously: well...

Chorus: T-Pain
Do you wanna ride?
In the backseat of a Caddy
Chop it up: with Do Or Die.
Do you wanna ride?
In the backseat of a Caddy
Chop it up: with Do Or Die."
92,Metallica,Until It Sleeps,"Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open: pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse: just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays: now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you: so hold me
It stains you: so hold me
It hates you: so hold me
It holds you: so hold me

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip: don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open: make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you: so hold me
It stains you: so hold me
It hates you: so hold me
It holds you: holds you: holds you

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

I don't want it: no
Don't want it: want it: want it: no

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open: make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps

(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)
Until it sleeps"
93,Crucial Conflict,Hay,"Sittin' on a quarter 'p of hay
Thangs is feelin' good today.
I'm tore up: from the floor up
Sippin on some crown royal.
Trippin': in a circle of wood
Where everybody smoke they own bud.
Good ole' hay
How you feel today?
Fine: blowed and dandy.
Silly like I'm hype off candy.
Gotta big: thick chic named sandy.
In the farm in the middle of the barn
Where everybody's feelin' crazy.
I went to visit granny's house.
Now I see why don't nobody leave.
We constantly: constantly: constantly smokin' b's.
Too blitzed to even shake it off
But I still got my head up.
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn
And get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut:
Blaze it up so I can hit that bud.
Git me zoned and I'll be on.
'Cause I love to smoke upon hay.

Smokin' on
Hay in the middle of the barn.
Smokin' on
Hay in the middle of the barn.

The hay got me goin' through a stage
And I just can't get enough.
Smokin' everyday
I got some hay
And you know I'm finna roll it up.
Make a cloud
I'm gonna take my mind away from all the
Bullcrap.
Bump my sounds
Lay back and roll
Mack to the freaks that's on the road.
Sometimes I wonder
When I was blowed on the streets.
Anybody wanna step to me:
I'ma see how rough they be.
In this session: manifesting
On myp's and q's
Never snooze 'cause I refuse.
Inhale: exhale the smell.
Smokin' hay all by myself.
Wildstle: laughin' loud.
Wit my homies by my side.
If somethin' jump off let it ride
On my square when time is live.
Everybody throw it up
Go to the barn and get some hay.
When I get my choke on.
Fool you know I'm smokin' on...

Hay now hay
We smokin' up hay in the middle of the barn
And I'm lit up
Can't get up
My eyes are red
And my head is spinnin.
Took another pull
Ridin' red bull
Got the goofies: can't stop grinnin.
Got a posse full of hoes playin' in my braids
And we bout to get in em.
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at
And everything funny.
Gotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high
Smokin' all that hay with no money.
Now truly this bitch wanna do me
So I hit the 151bacardi
She high like the sun
Thick like cornbread: and I'm ready to party.
That hay got me so gotdamn horny
But I don't like that tramp.
The only reason I'm poppin' that coochie
Cause the hoe had a book of foodstamps.
And I got the munchies
I need soul food.
Collard greens or pinto beans.
If you smoke hay like the conflict do:
Then you know what the hell I mean.

Rollin' down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack.
Got my niggas in the barn smokin' on that
Hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin' herb:
I creeped up on the wall and all I heard.
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in
The hay
With a funky dime word.
Couldn't be myself
Couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left.
Nigga would have lost my breath.
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint
But I can't
'Cause I roll around in dat barn ride.
Rollin' up the hootie hoo
Roughest skin roller on dat west side.
Nigga come on in
I got some hay
Won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for?
Ain't nobody to rich: we poor.
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn
The flies keep us chokin.
Thank you Jesus Christ
For all the hay you're givin' us
'Cause we'll keep on smokin'."

For me to give up:
I feel it's time:
Got a picture of you beside me:
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup:
Oh yeah:
Got a fist of pure emotion:
Got a head of shattered dreams:
Gotta leave it: 
Gotta leave it all behind now:

Whatever I said: whatever I did I didn't mean it:

(corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory:
But that was not to be:
In the twist of separation: 
You excelled at being free:
Can't you find: 
(can't you find)
A little room inside for me:

Whatever I said: whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good:

You see I want you back for good:
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it:

96,Pearl Jam,I Got Id / Long Road,"My lips are shaking: my nails are bit off
Been a month since I've heard myself talk
All the advantage this life's got on me
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea

And I fight back in my mind
Never lets me be right: oh
I got memories: I got shit
So much it don't show

I walked the line
When you held me in that night
I walked the line
When you held my hand that night

An empty shell seems so easy to crack
Got all these questions: don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're looking at me

And I'll stay in a bed
Oh could've seen it
If just once: I could feel loved
Oh: stare back at me: yeah

But I walked the line
When you held me in that night
Oh: I walked the line
When you held my hand that night
Oh: I walked the line
When you held me close at night
I paid the price: never held you in real life"
97,Faith Evans,Soon As I Get Home,"Your love is wonderful: yeah
And I don't wanna lose you
So: baby...

Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby: I'll do what I gotta do

Sleepless nights: and lonely days
Are all that fill my head
All of the time: oh: baby: but all I do
Is think about the way you make me feel
'Cause: baby: this love is so real

Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby: I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby: I'll do what I gotta do

If I try: to spend some time with you
To make you happy: would you feel better?
And if I could: with you I would be forever
Forever in love so...

Making love all through the night
We hold each other tight
I can take away the pain
If you would only let me
Just forget about the past
'Cause I wanna make it last
Baby: I apologize
'Cause: boy: I really need you in my life

Soon as I get home (when I get home)
I'll make it up to you (I'm gonna make it)

99,Hootie and The Blowfish,Only Wanna Be With You,"You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me
When I look at other girls

Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby
'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

Only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
Only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up and blue
Only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder
If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby yeah
The Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you"
100,Seal,Don't Cry,"Don't be so hard on yourself.
Those tears are for someone else.
I hear your voice on the phone.
I hear you feel so alone.
My baby.

Oh my baby.

Please my baby:

My baby:

When we were young:
And truth was paramount.
We were older then:
And we lived a life without any doubt.
Those memories:
They seem so long ago.

What's become of them?
When you feel like me I want you to know.
...They've all gone for sure...

Don't cry.
Not alone.
Don't cry:
Tonight: my baby.
Don't cry:
You'll always be loved.
Don't cry:
Tonight.
My baby.

Today I dreamed:
Of friends I had before.
And I wonder why.
The ones who care don't call anymore.
My feelings hurt.
But you know I overcome the pain.
And I'm stronger now:
There can't be a fire unless there's a flame.

Don't cry.
Your not alone.
Don't cry:
Tonight: my baby.
Don't cry.
You'll always be loved.
Don't cry oh...
Limousines and sycophants:
Don't leave me now:
'Cause I'm afraid what you've done to me.
Is now the wolf.
In my bed:

In my head.
In my head.
In my head.

The challenges: we took were hard enough.
They get harder now.
Even when we think that we've had enough.
Don't feel alone:
'Cause it's I who understands:
I'm your sedative:
Take a piece of me whenever you can.

Don't cry... you're not alone.
...Don't be so hard on yourself...

Don't cry... tonight my baby
...These tears are for... someone else...

Don't cry... you'll always be loved
...I hear your voice on the phone...

Don't cry... tonight sweet baby
...I hear you fear... so alone.

Don't cry... don't cry... don't cry... don't you cry...
...My baby
Cry... Don't cry...
'Cause you still be loved
Don't cry
Don't cry tonight
Oh...

My baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby my baby
...Ba da ba ba da da...
