1,Bobby Lewis,Tossin' And Turnin',"I couldn't sleep at all last night
Just a-thinkin' of you
Baby: things weren't right

Well I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

I kicked the blankets on the floor
Turned my pillow upside down
I never: never did before

'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

Jumped out of bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite

Rolled up the shade
Turned out the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night

The clock downstairs was strikin' four
Couldn't get you of my mind
I heard the milkman at the door

'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

Jumped outta bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite

Rolled up the shade
Turned off the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night

The clock downstairs was strikin' four
Couldn't get you of my mind 
I heard the milkman at the door

'Cause I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night

I was tossin' and turnin' 
Turnin' and Tossin' 
A tossin' and turnin' all day

I was tossin' and turnin' 
Turnin' and tossin' 
I was tossin' and turnin' all night"
2,Patsy Cline,I Fall To Pieces,"I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget (to forget)
Pretend we've never met (never met)
And I've tried and I've tried: but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name)
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too (love me too)
The way you used to do (used to do)
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces"

Michael rowed the boat ashore: halleluja

Sister helped to trim the sails: halleluja
Sister helped to trim the sails: halleluja

Michael rowed the boat ashore: halleluja
Michael rowed the boat ashore: halleluja

The river Jordan is chilly and cold: halleluja
Chills the body but not the soul: halleluja

Michael rowed the boat ashore: halleluja
Michael rowed the boat ashore: halleluja

The river is deep and the river is wide: halleluja
Milk and honey on the other side: halleluja

4,Roy Orbison,Cryin',
5,Del Shannon,Runaway,"As I walk along: I wonder
A-what went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong

And as I still walk on: I think of
The things we've done together
While our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why: why: why: why: why
She ran away

And I wonder
Where she will stay
My little runaway
A-run: run: run: run: runaway

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

And I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why: why: why: why: why
She ran away

And I wonder
Where she will stay
My little runaway
A-run: run: run: run: runaway
A-run: run: run: run: runaway

8,String-a-longs,Wheels,
9,Dee Clark,Raindrops,"Oh: Raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes.

Since my love has left me
I'm so all alone
I would bring her back to me
But I don't know where she's gone
I don't know where she's gone.

There must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
Oh: no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry.

So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes.

Oh: there must be a cloud in my head
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes.
Oh: no it can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry.

So it must be raindrops
So many raindrops
It feels like raindrops falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes.

It keeps on fallin'
Fallin' from my eyes
Woo: it keeps on fallin' from my eyes"
10,Joe Dowell,Wooden Heart (Muss I Denn),"Can't you see: I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start

Treat me nice: treat me good
Treat me like you know you should
'Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart

Muss I' denn: muss I' denn
Zum St&#xE4;dtele hinaus
St&#xE4;dtele hinaus
Und du mein Schatz bleibst hier

Muss I' denn: muss I' denn
Zum St&#xE4;dtele hinaus
St&#xE4;dtele hinaus

Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart"

12,Bobby Vee,Take Good Care Of My Baby,"My tears are fallin'
'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've got to say

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do

Ah: take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I'd been true 
I know she'd never be with you: so

Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Well: take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Ah: take good care of my baby
Well: take good care of my baby
Just take good care of my baby
Oh: take good care of my baby"
13,Roy Orbison,Running Scared,"Just runnin' scared each place we go
So afraid that he might show
Yeah: runnin' scared: what would I do?
If he came back and wanted you

Just runnin' scared: feelin' low
Runnin' scared: you love him so
Just runnin' scared: afraid to lose
If he came back which one would you choose

Then all at once he was standing there
So sure of himself: his head in the air
My heart was breaking: which one would it be
You turned around and walked away with me"
14,Shirelles,Dedicated To The One I Love,"This is dedicated to the one I love...

While I'm far away from you: my baby:
I know it's hard for you: my baby:
Because it's hard for me: my baby:
And the darkest hour is just before dawn---

Each night before you go to bed: my baby:
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby.
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love...

""Life"" can never be exactly like we want it to be.
I could be satisfied knowing you love me.
But there's one thing I want you to do especially for me---
And it's something that everybody needs.

Each night before you go to bed: my baby:
Whisper a little prayer for me: my baby:
And tell all the stars above---
This is dedicated to the one I love.
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love..."

18,Connie Francis,Where The Boys Are,"Where the boys are: someone waits for me
A smilin' face: a warm embrace: two arms to hold me tenderly

Where the boys are: my true love will be
He's walkin' down some street in town and I know he's lookin' there for me

In the crowd of a million people I'll find my valentine
And then I'll climb to the highest steeple and tell the world he's mine

'Til he holds me I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are: where the boys are
Where the boys are: someone waits for me

'Til he holds me I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are: where the boys are
Where the boys are: someone waits for me"

20,Sue Thompson,Sad Movies (Make Me Cry),"Sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
He said he had to work so I went to the show alone
They turned down the lights and turned the projector on
And just as the news of the world started to begin
I saw my darlin' and my best friend walk in
Though I was sittin' there they didn't see
And so they sat right down in front of me
When he kissed her lips I almost died
And in the middle of the color cartoon I started to cry
Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
And so I got up and slowly walked on home
And mama saw the tears and said ""what's wrong?""
And so to keep from telling her a lie
I just said ""sa-a-a-d movies make me cry""
Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
Ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh
Ooh: ooh: ooh: ooh
Sa-a-a-d movies make me cry-i-i"

Mother in law

Mother in law

The worst person I know
(Mother in law: mother in law)
(Mother in law: mother in law)

A she worries me: so
If she'd leave us alone
A we would have a happy home
Sent from down below

Mother in law: mother in law

Satan should be her name
To me they're 'bout the same
Every time I open my mouth
She steps in: tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low

I come home with my pay
She asks me what I made
She thinks her advice is the constitution
But if she would leave that would be the solution
And don't come back no more

Mother in law
My mother in law: ah
Oh: yeah"

23,Ricky Nelson,Travelin' Man,"I'm a travelin' man
Made a lot of stops all over the world 
And in every port I own the heart 
Of at least one lovely girl 

I've a pretty Seniorita waiting for me 
Down in old Mexico 
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see 
My cute little Eskimo 

Oh: my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town 
Makes my heart start to yearn 
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong 
Waits for my return 

Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea 
I remember the night 
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki 
And I held you oh so tight 

Oh: my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town 
Makes my heart start to yearn

25,Brook Benton,The Boll Weevil Song,"Let me tell ya a story about a boll weevil
Now: some of you may not know
But a boll weevil is an insect
And he's found mostly where cotton grows
Now: where he comes from: hm: nobody really knows
But this is the way the story goes

The farmer said to the boll weevil
""I see you're on the square""
Boll weevil said to the farmer
""Say yep: my whole darn family's here""

The farmer said to the boll weevil
""Say: why do you pick my farm""
The weevil just laughed at the farmer 'n' said
""We ain't gonna do ya much harm""
Ho-o-o-o-o:-o-o-o: -o-o-o: o-o-ome""

And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug.
He said ""Hey: I'd like to make a trade with you
But: ya see if I was a lightning bug
I'd search the whole night through""

And the boll weevil called the farmer: 'n' he said
""Ya better sell your old machines
'Cause when I'm through with your cotton
Heh: you can't even buy gasoline
""Stake me a home: gotta have a home

And the boll weevil said to the farmer: said "" Farmer
I'd like to wish you well""
Farmer said to the boll weevil
""Yeah: an' I wish that you were in ****"" home
Lookin' for a home
(Ah: you have a home all right: you have a home
A real hot home: ah)"

28,Marty Robbins,Don't Worry,"Don't worry 'bout me: it's all over now
Though I may be blue: I'll manage somehow.
Love can't be explained: can't be controlled
One day it's warm: next day it's cold.

Don't pity me: 'cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed it might happen to you.
Oh: oh: oh: oh: oh: love: kiss me
One time then go love: I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me.

Sweet: sweet: sweet: love will I want you to be
As happy as I when you love me
I'll never forget you your sweet memory it's all over now Don't worry 'bout me.

You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue Moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper: ""Please adore me.""
And when I looked: the moon had turned to gold: oh

Blue Moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own"

(Moody river: wooh)

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read: ""Dear love: I've done you wrong
Now I must set you free.

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend.""

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life

I looked into the muddy waters
And what could I see?
I saw a lonely: lonely face just
Lookin' back at me

Tears in his eyes
And a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life"
60,Ray Charles,One Mint Julep,"One early morning as I was walking
I met a woman: we started talking
I took her home to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don't remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss and then another
I didn't mean to take it further
One mint julep was the cause of it all

The lights were burning low: there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door up popped her father
He said: ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now: or face a slaughter""
I didn't know just what I was doing: I had to marry or face ruin

A mint julep: a mint julep
A mint julep: a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Now: I don't want to bore you with my troubles
But from now on I'll be thinking double
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

A mint julep: a mint julep
A mint julep: a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all"

For you've won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
Just take good care of her: take good care of her

Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
Just take good care of her: take good care of her

I must accept it: she loves you more than me
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
If she's happy: that will be my consolation
Just take good care of her: take good care of her

Take good care of her: take good care of her

And starts a fire there and then I lose control

A rockin' type a boogie is the kind a song
That makes this little baby wanna sing along
And though he maybe gets the tune alittle wrong
He still goes
(Boogie-on-na-day)

He isn't too young to really feel the beat
He rocks back and forth in his little seat
He claps both his hands and he taps his feet
And he sings

He is a hully-gully-bouncin-baby-boy
You know the record player is his favorite toy
And don't forget he's eveybodys pride and joy
When he goes

I know there isn't anyone to take a bet
But surely he's the youngest teenager yet
And probably the hippest of the diaper set
'Cause he goes
(Go man: I like that!)

He strolls in his stroller with the radio on
He doesn't go to sleep until the musics gone
He imitates the singer in the group
With a low down voice

And when its time to tuck him in his little bed
With all that music runnin' through his sleepy head
The little fella doesn't say goodnight
Instead: but he says
(Gone!)"

78,Brook Benton,Think Twice,"You don't know how much you hurt me
When you broke our precious vows
But I can't stop loving you
I know it's too late to turn back now

Though I said: ""Go on: be happy: bless you: child""
I thought you could guess somehow
My secret heart was saying
""Man: it's too late to turn back now""

Was I a fool from the start
Building castles in the skies?
Or did I just dream I saw
Heaven shining in your eyes?

If you knew how much I love you: yes: I do
Oh: my darling: your heart would bow
Mmm: yes: you'd know: you'd know why I have said
""It's too late to turn back now""

(Too late to turn back now)
Yes: I love you
(Too late to turn back now)"
79,Lonnie Donegan,Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor (On The Bedpost Overnight),"Oh-me: oh-my: oh-you
Whatever shall I do
Hallelujah: the question is peculiar
I'd give a lot of dough
If only I could know
The answer to my question
Is it yes or is it no

Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
On the bedpost overnight
If your mother says don't chew it
Do you swallow it in spite
Can you catch it on your tonsils
Can you heave it left and right
Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
On the bedpost overnight

Here comes a blushing bride
The groom is by her side
Up to the altar
Just as steady as Gibraltar
Why: the groom has got the ring
And it's such a pretty thing
But as he slips it on her finger
The choir begins to sing

Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
On the bedpost overnight
If your mother says don't chew it
Do you swallow it in spite
Can you catch it on your tonsils
Can you heave it left and right
Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
On the bedpost overnight

Now the nation rise as one
To send their only son
Up to the White House
Yes: the nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent
They pawn the burning question
What has swept this continent

Lonnie speaks:
If tin whistles are made of tin
What do they make fog horns out of?
Boom: boom!

Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
On the bedpost overnight
If your mother says don't chew it
Do you swallow it in spite
Can you catch it on your tonsils
Can you heave it left and right
Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
On the bedpost overnight

On the bedpost overnight

Man:
Hello there: I love you and the one who holds you tight

Lonnie:
Monday: Tuesday: Wednesday
Thursday: Friday: Sat'day night

On the bedpost overnight

Man:
A dollar is a dollar and a dime is a dime

Lonnie:
He's singin' out the chorus
But he hasn't got the time

On the bedpost overnight: yeah"
80,Connie Francis,Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart,"If my friends should ask for me
Here at home is where I'll be
There's no one I care to see
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart

Now the heartache has begun
There's a job that must be done
I'll have no time for havin' fun
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart

Aw: leave me alone
And let me cry: cry: cry
There are tears that must be cried
Till there's no more tears inside

Let me take a count of ten
Then: I'll bounce right back again
Let me be alone till then
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart"

86,Jimmy Dean,Big Bad John,"(Big John)
(Big John)

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245 
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip
To Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much he's kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all you just said ""hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fella to the Promised Land: Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast 
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last: 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree just stood there alone
Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out: ""There's a light up above.""
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave
And now there's only one left down there to save
Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line
For Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit 
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
""At the bottom of this mine lies a big: big man...
Big John""

Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear: are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know: someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was when we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change: you acted strange
And why I've never known

Honey: you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear: are you lonesome tonight?"
